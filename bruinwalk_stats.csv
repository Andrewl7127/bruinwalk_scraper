STATS 21,Python and Other Technologies for Data Science,Statistics,Miles Satori Chen,"{'Overall': 4.8, 'Users': 8.0, 'Easiness': 4.4, 'Clarity': 4.9, 'Workload': 4.6, 'Helpfulness': 4.8}",Winter,2022,B+,03/11/2022,"** The quarter I took this class was partially online due to Covid reasons, your experience may be different**--Overall, Miles Chen is a pretty good, clear lecturer. This class as a whole is also just about a useful topic in general too, and what you learn here should help jumpstart your knowledge toward data analyst and data science positions, so overall I think it's a good class to take. Note, however, that because there are pre-requisite Stats courses before this one, there's much less guidance compared to, say, Stats 20 (at least this was my experience). As someone who wasn't a very experienced programmer compared to some of my peers, I think I struggled a bit more than I'd like to admit during my time in this class.--The grading scheme was as follows:15% Lecture Viewing Quizzes20% Datacamp Homework36% Homework25% Final4% Campuswire Participation--Viewing quizzes, Datacamp, and Campuswire were basically free points, please do NOT forget about and waste them! Lecture-viewing quizzes weren't class content related, they were random letters, so if you're a data science expert you can't just skirt the quizzes. Datacamp was based on completion and was easy because there are tutorials on there, and Campuswire you just needed to get 150 points, plus an opportunity for extra credit if you went further (I think to 200?). Also, the premium subscription to Datacamp that you get for this class is valid for 6 months, so you can basically keep using it the quarter after you take this class which is excellent.--I mentioned before that you have to be more proactive and independent in this class compared to your other Stats lower divs and I think the homework reflects this. The first assignment was pretty straightforward and then it got more challenging from there. Not everything was straightforward and you sometimes had to think beyond the lecture examples, which admittedly are pretty clear but don't always directly relate to the homework. That said, reading the documentation online for the different libraries/data science technologies you're using is pretty helpful as is talking things out with peers. I didn't go to office hours too often but both Professor Chen and my TA Lucy seemed quite approachable and helpful so I'm sure that's a good way to go. Also, there were a lot of issues happening on campus the quarter this class happened that caused people mental distress, so Professor Chen was kind enough to give an extension on homework to everyone at that time.--The final was absurdly challenging and after talking with peers afterward, I don't think I was alone in not having completed the whole exam. The topics that appeared were also not what I expected; for example, there was a much bigger focus than I expected there to be on object-oriented programming. Personally, I think the final was the worst part of this class. That said, Professor Chen was pretty understanding and adjusted the grading upward on the final.--Overall I'd take this class again with Professor Chen, and would recommend you to take it as well.",1,0,POSITIVE,0.9886866807937622

I took him for Econ 41 awhile back, and took him for 106V last quarter. Econ 41 was terrible. The lectures were dry, basic, and a waste of time. I stopped going. The TAs stunk, the orange textbook was horrible, and I ended up depending on AP Stats knowledge. He posted old midterms, and I crammed the night before and regurgitated the answers because the tests ended up being nearly identical. But according to the more recent reviews below, this doesn't seem like this is the case for his Econ 41 class anymore. Also, his final was impossible. He teaches this class out of the scope of what it should be, and a lot of the methods are outdated. Using tables for different distributions has been totally obsolete for the past ~30 years. This class doesn't prepare you for 103 at all because it is taught in a stupid, time wasting, overly rigorous way.106V was slightly less crappy, but again, if you want to actually learn to invest, you're better off teaching yourself than putting yourself through this class. Once again, Rojas may know the theory behind things, but I find it hard to have someone teaching a class like INVESTMENTS. Once again, just regurgitated the powerpoints and the HW back onto the tests and got an A. Math 141 is a much better class. Having him teach 3 Econ classes every quarter as a Physics/Stats PhD (admittedly, some of the Econ classes he teaches are are just stats) just goes to show you the state of the UCLA Economics department.

I had never taken a stats class before, but I spent two weeks learning a little bit of it in high school. I was surprisingly happy to find how well I adapted to the class and coursework.ABOUT THE COURSE: The course was what you would expect it to be- STATISTICS. There are a lot of formulas and once you feel like you've mastered one, you are already onto the next couple of topics and formulas. Lectures were recorded, but like most professors will say, it is honestly best to attend the live lectures because there are interactive practice questions in the slides and it was really helpful to ask real-time questions and get responses. Each lesson is filled with new weekly material so each one is very important. It may feel overwhelming at times, especially if you are balancing 3/4/5 other courses, but it is manageable and Professor Zanontian is truly kind and accommodating.WEEKLY HOMEWORK (20%): There was a weekly homework assignment, with questions from the online textbook. The textbook IS REQUIRED, BUT a little copy of the textbook may or may not have been provided on the CCLE site. The homework assignments weren't too difficult and it was actually helpful going to office hours with Professor Zanontian because she is so sweet and not condescending and will take the time to help you out/guide you in the right direction with homework questions.WEEKLY QUIZZES (20%): There were weekly quizzes on the material learned in the class that week. They were mostly multiple choice, and straightforward. These quizzes were a great way to gain insight on how statistic questions are posed and help in preparation for the midterm and final. All quizzes are TIMED and I think(?) that were allotted 20 or 30 minutes for 10 questions each week. MIDTERM (20%): I got an 85% on my midterm. I was thrown off guard a bit on the content because I hadn't really practiced or dedicated too much time into the course. There were around 10 questions on the midterm that most students got wrong. What was helpful was that Professor Z held a session to chat about the problems we missed individually as students.

There might be a textbook listed under the schedule of classes page, but don't buy it, cause you're not going to need it.

He even canceled our lab on the tuesday of inaugaration so we would be able to watch it live. The labs are really easy, and the discussion sections aren't mandatory. If you wanted to, you could skip the lab sections too, because he usually gives you the assignment page in class, and you don't need any special software to do them.

For the 1st midterm, make sure you're comfortable with the using summation to find all the ways a certain outcome could occur. Its not in the handouts, but he goes over it a bunch of times in class, so write down all the examples. For the final (which is not really cumulative, even though in the beginning he says it will be), make sure you understand how to draw the two distributions (of the null and alternative hypotheses), and how they overlap, and where alpha and beta are. Also, know how to find the power of tests. This was stuff that wasn't emphasized in the homework, but came up on the exams.

My biggest problem with this class and the professor was the lectures. They were disorganized and pretty boring, with unhelpful slides and a lot of rambling on Almohalwas's part. Honestly, I think that attending the lectures was a waste of my time and would have been better spent learning the concepts on my own time. He also drops the lowest lab, lowest discussion assignment, and gives an extra credit lab, so there's a bit of wiggle room!

He is so organized from his lecture notes format to the way he organizes his Canvas classroom. He is a very kind, understanding, and funny professor. Even tho the actual subject is pretty boring and feels repetitive, Prof. Kim makes stats actually enjoyable with his jokes throughout the class, but he never gets too sidetracked and doesn’t waste the class’ time. You can tell he is super passionate about the subject. Stats gets VERY confusing towards the end of the quarter because you end up learning many different statistical tests that seem very similar, but have different purposes, but Prof. Kim had a review session before the final in which he outlined ALLLLLL the differences. This review session literally saved me on the final since he allows a page of notes on the midterm and final. He also responds to emails in a very timely manner and is very clear and direct with his responses. Even when there was a TA strike, he took over and held his own discussion sections and responded to all student emails that would have been directed at the TAs. He also added extra office hours. He handled the strike situation very very well!! Overall, incredible professor, especially for his first quarter teaching!! It honestly felt like he was a very seasoned teacher judging by how prepared and confident he was at every lecture. *Homework*Homework was pretty fair and usually took around an hour. It’s super easy at first, but then progressively becomes more challenging. It’s graded on accuracy, but again, it’s pretty fair and the lowest is dropped. Homework is assigned on a weekly basis.*Online Quizzes*These also start off super easy but then as the course progresses, the quizzes definitely became more difficult and kinda challenging (especially the theory ones). They were sometimes based on solving stats problems and sometimes based on “theory” taught in lecture. It’s five multiple choice/sometimes fill in the blank or select all and you get one hour so it’s not the worst thing ever and they’re manageable. These are also assigned on a weekly basis and lowest is dropped. *Labs/Discussion*These use a different language (R) not CoCalc from LS30A/LS30B. I thought R was a lot easier and more intuitive to use than CoCalc tbh. The labs are easier than LS30 series, but still were painful at times. We got kind of lucky because one of the TAs recorded his section where he guided us very clearly on the code so it was also manageable. Again, this is another fair component of the class–nothing is too difficult but it wasn’t super easy. Discussion is basically just where we do the labs and attendance is optional so I ended up skipping all of them and doing the labs on my own time. My TA never went over homework during section, but I heard one of them did. *Midterm*There’s one midterm (I think around either end of Week 5 or beginning of Week 6) that takes place in-person during the class lecture. It’s 20 multiple choice so it’s definitely doable during a 75 minute lecture. Prof. Kim lets you use a single page of notes (front and back) and he gives you a practice exam that is EXTREMELY similar to the actual midterm so this exam it’s honestly more than fair. You are allowed a basic calculator (not a TI-84 or other graphing calculator), but you really don’t need it because he uses pretty small numbers that you could calculate by hand if you did forget your calculator. It felt pretty easy but I think it’s because Prof. Kim prepares you very well and doesn’t write outlandish questions–he specifically stated that he writes his exam to be fair and he definitely does. If I remember correctly the average/median/mode was also pretty high. Just study the practice midterm and review your notes/homework and you should be okay! There was also no coding on our midterm.*Final Exam*Very similar comments to the midterm: very fair, one page of notes, calculator, etc. The only difference is it 25 MC and takes place during finals week so there’s 3 hours instead of just 75 minutes, but you really need only an hour max. The final only tests the content after the midterm too (but there are concepts that carry over from the beginning of the class–they’re just not directly tested). He gives a practice final that is also VERY similar!!! Study that and you should honestly be fine, but just be very careful about wording bc in stats you will learn that there are SPECIFIC ways you have to phrase certain things. Prof. Kim makes this very clear during lectures so make sure to take note of these specific wordings!! The final honestly felt so fair and pretty easy thanks to him. Also go to the review sessions before!*Extra Credit Notes*You literally get extra credit for writing what he writes on the board! Super easy points. *Overall*Literally just take the class with Prof. Kim–do not hesitate and you will not regret this at all! Amazing class and professor!",0,0,POSITIVE,0.9983035326004028

Also all the math questions were nothing more than plug and chug. The final average was 80 and was definitely easier and didn't have none of the above as an answer choice.

He was genuinely caring towards students' well being, especially mental health. He stressed this multiple times throughout the quarter, gave us free points on quizzes and exams related to this, and extended deadlines when he felt the workload was too much. Additionally, no textbook was required and you get everything you need just from his lectures. They were generally shorter lectures too, the allotted time is normally 50 min a lecture but most of the time they were closer to 30-40 minutes.

It was manageable if you didn't leave things to the last minute however. I felt that the graders were a bit harsh, but still did well on most assignments. Prof Tsiang did require Campuswire participation, which you could also get EC through which I thought might be a nuisance at first, but was super easy and the majority of the class got most points for this. I would say try to get most of your points early on so you don't have to worry about it as much later on, but I checked Campuswire maybe three times a week and tried to answer or ask a question each time and achieved the extra credit level before week 8.The exams were a bit harder, but you have plenty of time and open notes so I think just understanding concepts, and understanding the wording Professor emphasizes and keeping a diagram of the validity conditions is super helpful.

Recorded lectures were pretty straight forward, and I thought that I was well-versed in the material. Fast forward to Exam 1, I got a 77% (class average was 78%) and I was shook.

I am not too upset, since I was expecting a B, but I wish I would have been prepared on how detailed I needed to be when it came to short answer questions. Also he bombarded us with lecture videos Week 5, and it was just a bit too fast-paced and it was frustrating. I had many peers feel the same way as well.

Nevertheless, I tried to go in with an open mind. Unfortunately, Tsiang did not help this situation. For 2 hours, you basically sit and listen to him read from slides verbatim. It was borderline painful some mornings. Again, maybe this is because I just didn't find the material interesting or maybe it was just presented in a really boring way. In terms of the class, the tests are all multiple choice and you get a cheat sheet, but they are still pretty tricky. Best advice is to look at the conceptual multiple choice from the textbook chapters (he steals questions from here). There are twice weekly discussions, but in one per week the TAs go over the weekly labs and basically give you the answers which is nice. The other discussion per week is spent going over example problems. Each week you have homework which definitely takes a while to complete and is graded on accuracy which is just annoying. Although he gives some extra credit opportunities, it is for a very low level (1% max of final grade).  Lastly, I agree with the previous poster about the CampusWire arrogance. Although I think what he was trying to do was get students to think about the concepts and come up with the answers themselves, he does this in a very poor and rude manner.

Maybe this was an off summer for Tsiang, but the guy is not what he is made out to be by this bruinwalk page. People saying he's funny are saying that because every 30 or so minutes in his (painfully dull) 2 hour lectures, he says ""aint nobody got time for that""  and it wakes a portion of the class up. Maybe that is enough for the kind of people who write bruinwalk reviews to consider him funny. See, I accidentally missed the course evaluation deadline, so now I have to settle for a bruinwalk review in the hopes that it finds whoever tracks the progress of junior lecturers. One positive for Tsiang is that he gives great life advice before tests. He reminds students that mental health, sleep, and overall well-being is far more important than any grade. I respect his thoughts on this. That being said, his tests were still tough and required a lot of preparation. Also, anybody who says he is a ""nice guy"" or teaches with ""good clarity"" is either tripping or had a different teacher. This guy is far and above the most condescending teacher I have ever experienced. Though it is hard to tell whether he is robot or human from lecture, when you actually meet with this guy in person, you quickly realize that the attitude he puts out on Campuswire is true to he actually is. Campuswire is an online forum and part of the class is participating on it by asking and answering questions. If you somehow find the patience to rack up 50 upvotes on your responses, you can earn a whopping .5% of extra credit. I swear to you, on every singly discussion topic you click, you can find a condescending response from Tsiang, shaming the person for asking, and completely dodging the task of actually answering the question posed. He manages to consistently leave you guessing in confusion, putting a roundabout bullshit response to any and everyone who dare ask for help on the website.

Stats 13 with Schoenberg is mediocre.  The professor is boring and dry, making it difficult to listen to him in class. The TA's are all too smart and can't relay the information in a way for the students to understand well. However, there is a way to get an A in this class. First off, the lab homework (10%) are all related to R-code. The labs are a pain and way beyond the scope of the course. But the good thing is that there is nothing related to R code on the tests. To be honest, find yourself a person who knows R-code and ask them to help you out. The homework isn't that bad. there was only 4 homework assignments for the whole quarter and I'm pretty sure the homework between all stats 13 classes are similar. The best way to study for the tests is to print out all the slides, go over them on your own time by writing down the problems and concepts. Schoenberg gives you a list with all the concepts that will be covered on the exam, make sure you have an example that illustrates that concept if you make a study guide (along with what the concept is). Do all this, and you are pretty much guaranteed an A. It's definitely a self-study class, but very manageable compared to all other self-study classes. Besides the R-code, nothing is that bad. I would go as so far to say this is one of the easier lower-divs out there for life science. Selling the following: Midterm, R-code for the labs (TA: Duncan), In-Class slides, textbook, Study guide (includes concepts + example problems for every concept) and Homework problems.",0,0,NEGATIVE,0.9975727200508118

That being said, it can be difficult to pay attention because he will go over the same slides repeatedly- which is great if you can stay awake! This class was supposed to be a walk in the park, but unfortunately I had an awful TA and it ruined my experience. If Duncan Clark is TA'ing, DO NOT take section with him. He is awful and gives out labs that are significantly harder than the other TAs. He gave his sections 8 labs, versus the other TA who only gave 3 labs during the quarter that were much easier. Both midterm and final are open book and multiple choice, so as long as you pay attention and have a good TA you should be set.  I just want to caution that the midterm was only 16 questions, so make sure you have everything you need going into the exam. I made the mistake of not printing all the slides with notes, so I missed more questions than I should have. Lastly, Schoenberg does award improvement from midterm to final. He doesn't have an exact metric for it but if you show up for class and your score goes up, he will bump you up a bit. Overall, this class really wasn't my jam but Schoenberg was very fair and made it a tolerable experience.

He said BLM in zoom lecture and im just 😭😭😭 All fun aside here are some of logistics: Because I took it during Spring 2020, ie the coronavirus time, classes are held online and format has been changed. We had 10 quizzes in total (the last one is optional). In the beginning they are called quizzes because you only have 45 minutes to complete them and no collaboration is allowed, but after the first few tries Prof Christou decided to the quizzes more like homework on the weekend.

It gives you the taste of graduate school, the ""challenging academic life"" that you always want to have as stated in your Statement of Purpose. I took 100B and 100C with him. I spent at least 3 hours every weekday to study for his class alone. His tests force you to learn, and sadly, yes, you have to put more priority to his class in order to do ""good"" on the tests.

His lectures go REALLY fast, so sometimes you have to look at the lecture notes that are posted after class, which can be annoying. Homework was medium difficulty, and the overall workload was manageable. The thing you need to remember about Christou's exams is that their difficulty is balanced by a FAT curve. The class is medium difficulty, but people think it's really hard just because they get bad scores on the exams. While you definitely have to put in effort to get an A, it's very achievable. Probably my favorite aspect of the course is that Christou views exams as learning opportunities rather than opportunities to punish negligent students. He makes the exams really hard and doesn't tell people the letter grade cutoffs until the very end of the course so that people focus on learning the material rather than achieving X% on their overall grade. If you regularly put in effort, you're pretty much guaranteed to pass the class, even though it might not seem like it.You can tell that Christou cares a lot about student learning just by looking at how frequently he holds office hours. However, he can often be rude or impatient when students ask really basic questions. To some degree I don't blame him because people sometimes ask things that they could easily find the answer to themselves, but a lot of the time his frustration is unwarranted. Overall, the main thing I found lacking about the course was that there was too much emphasis on derivation/matrix manipulation and not enough emphasis on the ramifications/interpretation of the results that Christou showed in class. For example, one of the bedrock principles of linear models is that we pick the linear combination of random variables that minimizes the mean squared error. While Christou touched on this briefly, he didn't really go over why this is so important, and mainly just focused on deriving all the least squares formulas. You could easily get an A in the class without knowing how this concept relates to actual statistical modelling, and why it's such a crucial concept to understand.

He adjusted the syllabus to account for the online format (got rid of the 20+ homeworks he normally assigns and replaced them with weekly quizzes) and did lectures multiple times a day for people in different timezones. His office hour schedule is legendary; more than two hours a day pretty much 6 days a week if not 7. This class is not church, you can't get away with going once a week and falling asleep. Tests are ridiculously hard but Christou doesn't treat tests like punitive assessments meant to punish people. Before every test he reiterates that the objective of the tests are to learn new material and apply concepts in different ways rather than just rehash the quizzes/homeworks and he's completely right–I learn a lot and enjoy being challenged by the tests. Pro tip: pay attention in class and take notes, he's a clear lecturer and not everything you need to know is on the handouts.  Smith (the TA) was also really good and amde concepts much simpler to understand. Some parts of the class were in R, but he goes over the code in lectures and if you're taking this you're probably a stats major so seriously–learn R. Those were the easiest assignments all quarter and in my opinion, also the most practical.Fundamentally, this is a professor who went out of his way to conduct multiple lectures a day, record review videos outlining concepts once a week (in addition to lectures), conduct office hours nearly every day, and made sure to start each class with a preamble about the state of the world–coronavirus, the BLM movement–and reminding us to look after our mental health. He made the final optional and recorded a thank you video at the end of the quarter of himself giving a really inspiring speech in front of the math-sci building.

Christou cares a lot about his students as he holds at least two hours of office hours every day.

First exam average was a 33%, second exam a 35%. He didn't tell us what the final exam average was, and I have no idea how I did on the final. He emailed us to come to his office hours if we want to see our final exam. Also he grades harshly on the exams, and I noticed he doesn't provide any feedback to us on the exams; he just wrote how many points we got deducted on each problem.Towards the end of the quarter, he told us the cutoff for an A- was about a 40%, and a B- is >25%.

Because of this, he gave us a little more time for the second quiz, I believe 24 hours if I remember correctly.

For those of you wondering why you had to take math classes on differentiation, integration and linear algebra, this class will make you understand why. First, be prepared to take some of the hardest exams you will have ever taken. I had Math majors, Political Science PhD students and people interning for SpaceX complain that Christou's tests were the hardest they had ever taken. It is no joke when I say that some kids have either cried while taking the test or cried after taking the test, and it wasn't out of relief.For example, the average on the two midterms were a 54 and a 52, with a standard deviation of 16 and 18, respectively. I got a 59 and a 52, respectively, and I was happy to get those scores. (I thought the final was very easy comparatively, which is why I ended up with an A- instead of a B or a B+).However, his curve is very generous. For example, based on the scores of the two midterms mentioned above, if you got a 60 or above, you got at least an A-. Between a 40 and a 60 was some form of a B and below 40 was some form of a C. So long as you attempt the test and do not cheat, Christou will never give you anything lower than a passing grade. As for the HWs, they are hard. He has around 8 HW assignments, and they usually required 5-6 hours minimum to complete, if you don't have help from the TA. (I remember the study group I was with thought that there was no way the exam could be harder than the HWs. Trust me, the exam can ALWAYS be harder than the HWs.) Some will require you to use R, however, he will have R code posted online on his website that you can essentially copy with a few modifications to make it work. It's mostly to try and explain conceptual ideas or to make calculations easier, as some problems involve taking the inverse of a 4x4 or a 5x5 matrix and then multiplying it by its transpose, or finding the eigen values of a 4x4 or 5x5 matrix (see what I mean by using Linear Algebra?). Other times you have to find the gradient of a multivariate function, so brush up on your math if you don't remember.In terms of lectures, Christou is arguably the fastest talker you will ever meet. One of my favorite jokes is that he'll explain a concept in a couple minutes then expect you to solve a problem using that concept in around 10 seconds (I wish I was kidding). He does tend to skip over steps when he solves problems, so you'll be doing a lot of tracing back to figure out how he got from point A to point B. He is also a big stickler on using any electronic device in class and being constantly late (although you won't be using any electronic device or be late as he goes over a lot of material in the class and you'll be busy writing down notes). Christou also doesn't use notes in class, everything is either by memory or pure knowledge while lecturing. In terms of office hours, you will thank the Lord as he has office hours usually every day, for around an hour or two each day. While he can be intimidating, he really has the students interests at heart. If anyone has had Vivian Lew, they know she speaks her mind. Lew had a very glowing opinion of Christou, saying he's one of the nicest professors in the Stats department and that he really cares about the students learning. And it's true. Christou also has a twisted sense of humor, as he'll joke around before taking the exam saying things like ""Drink safely after the exam, ok?"" or ""I would joke, but I figure I don't want to get your spirits up right before the exam.""The TL;DR version is that, as Christou puts it, ""I believe in giving exams that challenge the students to the best of their ability, but don't want them worrying about the grade.""

I hope this long review/guide will give you a better understanding of what this class will be like:***1. Grading Structure (original scheme on the syllabus, see comment for adjustments and actual grading structure):18% Homework, 20% MT 1, 20% MT 2, 30% Final, 12% Final Project, 1% Extra credit for Discussion Attendance, 0.5% Extra credit for Campuswire participation- Mike made several adjustments during the quarter to alleviate stress for students, including: #1. Canceling the final project #2. Allocating 25 pts to the better MT score and 15 to the other. #3. Grading the homework on satisfactory completion, rather than correctness (although the graders will provide helpful comments if your code doesn’t pass certain cases). #4. Dropping the lowest homework (best 7 out of 8) and #5. Giving everyone the attendance credit***2.Grade distributions: MT1: Mean 62.67; Quartiles: 55, 61.67, 76.25MT2: Mean 64.47; Quartiles: 51.67, 65, 76.67 Final: Mean 67.9; Quartiles: 55.56, 68.89, 80Don’t get scared yet and read on. According to the professor, here is your rough letter grade break down (before the curve at the end of the quarter) if your performance is consistently:In the lower 25% (x < Q1): B/B-In the lower 25%-50% (Q1 < x < Q2): A-/B+/BIn the upper 25%-50% (Q2 < x < Q3): A/A-In the upper 25% (x > Q3): A+/A***3.General remarks:--> On lectures: Professor Tsiang uploads lecture videos ahead of time, so the scheduled lecture times are really office hours. I recommend watching the lectures ahead of time and coming to OH with questions about concepts or HW. Although Mike follows his lecture notes closely in the videos, you should still watch the lectures instead of just reading the notes, since you see the process of building functions (plus the professor will mention some small examples and conceptual details that are not in the notes)--> On homework: the homework assignments are graded on satisfactory completion so don’t panic if you are stuck on a question. Try to complete as many parts as you can and write out pseudocode/ thoughts on how the logic should go for the others that you are stuck on. There is also a 1 day grace period (meaning you can submit your homework up to 24 hours late without penalty). I don’t recommend stressing and working on the HW till the last minute of the grace period. It’s better to turn in parts that show effort than pushing for the complete solution and missing the deadline. The professor and the learning assistant are willing to discuss the homework with you after submission so you can always go back and finish the solution. --> On getting help: You should definitely ask questions on Campuswire, which is pretty active (Mike responds quickly, and other students give advices as well). There are a few things to note: #1. Please search up if someone has already asked the question and has gotten an answer. Professor Tsiang and the TAs in this case will most likely just respond with a link to the old post. #2. Both Mike and the TAs do not like giving away too much of the answer and their hints may seem “cryptic”. Please be patient and know that this is the necessary struggle for you to figure something out slowly on your own. Feel free to follow up after you have made a little progress with that hint to get the next hint. My suggestion for you is to discuss your thought process with Mike at his OH, where he is more prone to give away a bit too much ;)--> On this course’s reputation: Stats 20 seems to have a notorious reputation now mainly due to students’ past experiences with Jake. Here’s my thought and I implore you to read it through before judging. Jake is very knowledgeable in the course material and passionate about student learning. He is, however, not the most patient when students ask questions that have been answered before or do something in the code that is explicitly forbidden in the instructions. If you paid attention to the lectures, followed the rules, and asked a thoughtful question, he will most definitely try to give you a helpful response (subject to #2 from “On getting help”). Jake wants to challenge students to think about how could everything go wrong, which is why he focuses on edge cases; this is why I think him being a not-so-beginner-friendly TA for a very tough class really stresses out students and makes them feel like he is adding unnecessary difficulty. If you disagree with my thoughts, that is fine. I also agree that Jake can try to be more approachable to reduce unintentional tension in interactions with students. HOWEVER, I ask you to please voice your suggestions/frustrations in your course evaluations, not on Reddit. We have had enough posts that it has descended into a trend of hate bashing (I suspect that there are individuals who have not even take the course writing on the posts). I write my review here also so that it does not get drowned out immediately by mindless downvotes. I do not want this to become a hateful “urban legend” that scares off students who are interested in Stats and want to take this class. Anonymity allows lots of toxicity in the threads, and I urge you not to add more. For everyone who took Stats20 this fall, if you think I am BSing or doubt my identity, feel free to reach out and talk to me - R.B.--> On difficulty and succeeding in this class: The class is very challenging but will cover many key concepts that will allow you to straight-up start working on some data analysis projects. You will need to devote lots of time to homework and should do some exploring on your own (playing with functions and see how they work together) to truly get a strong understanding. Mike will tell you many times to focus on the learning and let him take care of the grades. Please have some faith in his statement, even if you are struggling, because he does mean it. As you can see from the stats from the Grade distribution section, your numeric score doesn’t even come close to the letter grade you may associate it with. Mike spends a lot of time at the end of the quarter applying curves and assigning grades because he knows it is a hard class. Have faith in yourself. You most definitely will not come even close to failing if you’ve put in the effort. Lastly, if you need help - an HW extension or reschedule MT due to time zone - reach out to Mike; he cares about students’ mental being and is aware of the difficult times we live in. I am sure he will help you out as much as he can.",13,0,NEGATIVE,0.9793229103088379

LOTS OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED, so this review might give you a kind of portrait of how this class looks like.-**If you have coding experience before, this class should be very easy for you. Just take this class with Michael if you are confident with you coding. You can get an A easily if you have medium to strong coding basis.-The lecture: Michael is an excellent lecturer, and with his notes posted on CCLE, he also makes his class understandable for those who have no coding experience before. The lectures are podcasted and posted on CCLE so it is possible not to go in person. Besides, the lectures are super clear and self-explanatory.-Grading distribution: 20% Midterm 1, 20% Midterm 2, 30% Final, 15% Homework, 10% Final project, 3% Discussion Participation, 2% Campuswire Participation (with 1% extra credit).-The grading is pretty nice. This class is not based on the absolute scale, which means this class is curved based on the class performance. Roughly, the top 25% of the class is in A+/A range, 25%-50% is in A/A- range, 50%-75% is in A-/B+/B range, 75%-100% is in B/B-/lower range. Just for your reference, about 40% of the class get an A/A+ at the end, so the A rate is roughly 35% - 40%. Michael eventually allocate 25% to the better midterm and 15% to the lower one, so final grade should be boosted.-The exams, especially midterm 2, are quite tough. If you have no coding experiences, you might have to work very hard to get yourself into the top 25%. The worst thing I think is that the total marks of each exam is very low, around 30 marks in total. So you cannot afford to lose many points. There are around 15 multiple choice questions and three free reponse questions for each midterm. If you fail to answer one single free response, then you are screwed. The final is around 15 multiple choice, 10 short answer, and 5 free response. Overall, you cannot afford to lose many points in the exam.-The homework: Homework tasks are assigned either weekly or biweekly, and they are graded based on completion. So as long as you attempted all the questions, you will get the full mark. However, these tasks are VERY VERY time consuming. If you are not CS major/not very famililar with coding, then spending more than 3 hours, probably average 5 hours on each hw is highly possible. Make sure you understand all the basic and intermediate questions in the hw to get yourself well prepared for the exams.-The project: Michael cancelled the project at the end of the quarter, which is very nice. So the final grades are calculated and divided by 90 in total.-Overall, this class is a major-like class, which means it is not easy at all. You will definitely learn lots of coding things of R language, but you do have to spend lots of time on this class. You should also prepare comprehensively for the exams to get a decent grade. Michael is one of the most professinal instructors and best lecturer I've ever met. His lectures are very clear and easy to follow. If you have extra coding experience or foundation, this class wont be that hard, and getting and A is definitely highly possible.",7,0,POSITIVE,0.9949769377708435

For an introductory programming class, this is an extremely demanding and difficult course, especially if you have little to no programming experience before. While Mike is a very nice professor, he is really nothing more than a  presenter for lectures. All he does is read off his notes, which makes going to lectures pretty useless. His notes are clear,  but he has restructured the class in a way they are unhelpful.  Mike pushed the chapter on loops to the beginning of the class (used to be the second to last chapter), but none of the notes until the LAST CHAPTER  use loops, but all the homework do so you're left extremely confused on the very lengthy and time consuming homework assignments. The real problem with the class is TA Jake Kramer. He's responsible for the most difficult problems on the homework (ranked choice voting) and enforcing a general policy of  being unhelpful for all other TA's and Mike too. He is also responsible for putting RIDICULOUS problems on the exams that over 90% of the class gets wrong and you will only  get if you come across them by pure chance messing around in R. These questions don't even test general knowledge of R and with the 45 minutes you have for the exams its extremely difficult to even finish them.  Jake and Mike might read these reviews and scoff at them, but when  the averages are 58% and 53% on the midterms and a third of the class gets a 0% on one homework assignment because they have EVEN ONE syntax error in their answers, there is a clear problem with the class. Ironically, having  Jake as your TA might be the best thing because then you can maybe pick up on what, type of edge-case problems he might throw in the exam.Mike and Jake are very active on campuswire, which seems helpful at first , but only leave these cryptic answers that leave you more confused. Even if its a question with the instructions on their own problem,  they won't even give you a simple yes or no. In the end.

I should have written a review earlier, but I was hesitant because I thought I was the only person who had a bad opinion of him and Jake Kramer. Apparently, that's not the case. Why I didn't like Michael Tsiang and Jake Kramer:1. HW assignments were not clear with instructions. I asked Michael Tsiang if he wanted us to use a specific function, but he said it's up to the grader.  Funny thing is, professors are supposed to be in charge. Our grader, Jake Kramer, didn't tell us which function he is looking for but dings us off for inefficient codes. This is supposed to be a beginner-friendly class because there are many people learning how to code for their first time. Also, what's the point of being REALLY VAGUE on homework assignments and then taking off points for that even though many of us had the correct output? It's not even the students' fault at this point. 2. Lectures aren't really worth going to. Michael Tsiang just reads off his slides. You're better off ditching and just learning yourself, and then ask questions at another professor's office hour. Don't waste your time with Tsiang or Kramer's office hours. 3.  Jake Kramer does irrelevant things in general and it seems like he's trying to ""flex"" his knowledge on his students.  His practice midterms are questions on steroids that even most professors can't solve. It's really a waste of time on both ends if the exam is going to be totally different from the practice midterm. 4. The definition of acceptable does not mean full credit, according to Jake Kramer. He will say that some things are acceptable on Piazza, but then dings you off anyways because ""acceptable does not mean full credit."" 5. ""Don't worry about your grade"" is the biggest lie I've ever heard. I ended up with a B- in this class because of the outrageous difficulty with the homework assignments. Homework assignments are meant to buffer your grades from low exam scores, but my homework assignment grade definitely dragged me down.

It's slightly tough(probably easier than 2019), but he's changed a lot about the class so that it doesn't kill you mentally. For one, he made homework grading based on satisfactory completion rather than accuracy. Second, he allowed 24 hour late submissions on each homework. So, he was generally really supportive of students and made sure to echo this belief in the occasional email he sent us. Exams were timed and while most questions were straightforward, some were slightly challenging. However, he curves and pretty generously at that(2/3rds of the class gets some form of an A IIRC, no one fails). Coming to his lectures, he puts up recordings of them with chapter notes, and hosts an Office Hours during lecture time, when you can just come around, ask doubts, hang out.

To be entirely fair, I did not have Jake as a TA, and I never interacted with Prof. Tsiang personally, so I can't comment on them as people. But Prof. Tsiang was shockingly fair. I came in with very, very low expectations. First of all: the homework, at least when I took it, was based on effort. Not on correctness, which from the previous reviews, I assume is a new grading metric. It's INCREDIBLY nice.

That's some hella strong curving. I won't say that the past reviews are invalid, but it does seem that he's changed the class quite a bit to adjust to this criticism.

As a stu with CS background, I lost point simply because the TA Jake's secret rubric : you're a  new coder and this doesn't seem to be okay to me. And even they follow a strict rubric, they never post it so we won't realize the mistake until we get point deducted. The first homework average is 70 and midterm 1 exam average is 60 because he adds free-response question. Also, he adds a lot of homework. 3 hw due right before midterm 2. Although he encourages us to take care of health, but  this kind of irrational amount of work and waste of time is not necessary. Would rather take more CS courses to gain insights and more reasonable logic and self study code. (they even don't allow to store variable name to another varible to save memory but this makes no sense for CS stu who takes CS33! cuz R is such a low-level and basic language. If you know CS, you would know a lot of things they post are nonsense). Also, I feel that for this class, you just memorize the syntax and that's it, which is so boring.

In a coding course, it's typical for students to Google the challenging assignment problem as far as students understand them and write the answers in their own words. Such a learning method is different from copying code.Furthermore, one of my friends was accused of an offense he had never done. In Michael's email, he said his action is the best for students' long run; the truth is we don't appreciate such rude movements. Let me tell you the consequence of such unreasonable referring. Once Michael refers the student to the Dean's office, removing the 'DR' notation on the student's transcript will take another quarter, no matter whether the student commits something or not. The 'DR' notation can be a disaster for the students who want to apply to graduate school during this period. Even if you receive an A after your case is closed, it won't help anymore.

TLDR: This class is very good! You just have to put in the time and make an effort to go to office hours and practice outside of class. This class provides a very strong foundation in R and prepares you for the 101 & 102 series, other classes, and even research! If you read the past reviews, just go into the class with an open mind and don't stress! I took this along with 3 other STEM classes and found this to be a decent time-sink, but rewarding and not too stressful.---STRUCTURE: ~8 homework assignments, 2 midterms, Campuswire participation, discussion attendance, and a final (additional final project was cancelled)---INSTRUCTION: Professor Tsiang and our TA Edouardo are extremely knowledgeable about R and statistics in general (he teaches 100C as well) and emphasize student learning entirely over stressing about grades. Some may interpret his constant concern as disingenuous, but if you go to OH and/or talk to him outside of class, you will see that it is genuine! They say that you don't need any coding experience but I HIGHLY recommend acquainting yourself with some form of programming beforehand, it doesn't have to be much or even a whole course like CS 31 or PIC 10A. Some folks were struggling with functions and control flow late into the quarter which surprised the instructors. In each asynchronous lecture, Professor Tsiang explained topics in detail and performed examples. These were mainly covered in lecture note PDFs, but there's some conceptual questions for you to think about on your own; I highly recommend you try to do each one and go to OH if you can't think of a solution. R has a few intricacies such as vectorization (which makes many for-loops you would typically make in C++ or Python inefficient and actually discouraged) and indexing from 1 which make previous knowledge start to hurt more than help, so again, go to office hours! In discussion section, Edouardo went over difficult concepts and commonly-made mistakes on past and current homework assignments. The LAs also had their own office hours and were very helpful when going over your own exams and homework assignments.---EXAMS: It seems like the grading and type of questions are much less strict than previous quarters. The average scores were in the 70s or 80s which is typical of any slightly difficult STEM lower division course. They include function-writing, finding and fixing errors in code, and a tiny bit of data analysis. These exams were quite stressful but as long as you have been paying close attention to lecture and doing the homework, you should be able to get a decent score. There is a massive curve at the end in which about half of the class gets some form of an A, so don't expect to need a 90%+ or third-quartile (or even median sometimes) score on exams to get a good grade in the class. Don't stress and try to focus on learning the material, not achieving an A. If you want an easy A and aren't concerned about having a solid foundation in R, there's nothing wrong with that! I just wouldn't recommend this class however.---HOMEWORK: These are similar to exam questions, except they are graded on completion and effort! There are easy-intermediate-optional hard questions on almost every assignment, however once they're graded only the easy solutions are posted. This was a bit annoying, but it forces you to think about your code and maybe go to OH to find out what's wrong with it. I liked that a lot of the questions made you create your own versions of base functions in R because it makes you really understand the base functions and their intricacies. The homework may take a few hours to do, so start early and take breaks. Use Campuswire to discuss the questions you are allowed to, it really helps! P.S. Asking questions and answering other people's questions gets you free points, and if you do it enough then a tiny bit of extra credit!---I hope whoever reads this finds this useful and accurate; details such as exam structure and lectures will be different since I took this online during the pandemic.

It's also not the end of the world if you have Jake as your TA.Workload: Very heavy. I cannot stress this enough. We had 7 homeworks in the quarter, and each one of them takes 4-8 hours if they're done well. The last problem is always a very difficult ""challenge problem"" and usually they are nearly impossible to answer unless you stumble on the solution through sheer luck or have a stroke of coding brilliance. Luckily, they're weighted a little less heavily than the rest of the homework, so you can do average (or above average) and still miss the challenge questions.Lectures/Professor: Mike's lectures are VERY similar to his notes, and he only expands on things a little bit verbally, so you can really substitute one for the other, depending on your learning style. Outside of lecture, Mike is very nice and approachable, but he does tend to be vague in his answers. Mike is VERY accommodating to situations if you're struggling. I feel like he gets a bad rap, but he wants you to do well, and if you take an interest in the class and go to his OH/ask questions he'll remember your name and try help if you're struggling.Pace/Structure: Overall the class is decently well-structured in the first half (apparently this is a change from fall 2019) but the one thing that frustrates me is that loops are covered so early and then we're penalized for using them. Mike/Jake frequently say that you should use loops as little as possible, but I found myself frequently struggling to avoid them because they're the easiest way to solve a lot of the problems. Around week 6/7 and the second midterm, the pace of the class goes crazy. While the quantity of material (1 chapter/week) doesn't change, the difficulty of the material skyrockets. The chapters and lectures get much, much denser and the homework problems get a lot more complex. I also wish the last few chapters had been covered more in depth because they felt very rushed.Grading: There is a massive curve in this class. If you're about average on the homeworks and midterms, you're almost guaranteed a B+ or better. The way you receive grades is super wack, because you'll never get an answer key for the homework, just feedback on what you did wrong or right. You can take that to office hours and ask questions, but it's a pain in the ass to try and ask about all the missed points, especially when you sometimes can't even tell what you did wrong. The midterms are even more wack because you get nothing but a score and the class distribution. The other big problem, which I'm hoping doesn't happen again, is that grades were delayed by about a month or so. We got scores for the 5th week homework during finals week, and were missing three homework grades when we took the final, which definitely impaired people's ability to choose whether to take the class P/NP.[I'm going to add to this review after the quarter is actually over, but I wanted to get it up to start off with]The best thing about this class is that you come out of it with a very well-developed knowledge of R.

Stats 20 was definitely the class that I had the largest workload for for this quarter, but I'm not sure if I'd say the workload was too much. There's about a homework assignment every week, and each homework assignment took be a total of about 6ish hours each. That said, I do have some coding experience, so idk if I'm the best judge of this.Did the stats department turn this class into a weeder course?No. The grading for this class in terms of percentages is very low and the grading is very harsh. They'll take off points on homework for not taking into account situations they never tell you to take account for, and the midterms will cover things that there is no way you would have learned except maybe by pure coincidence while ""playing around in R"". All of that is pretty dumb, in my opinion. However, your final letter grades for the class will all be based on how well you do relative to everyone else in the class. So even though I'd say I did very bad in terms of how many points I got on each homework and midterm, I still got an A for my final grade. It's not really right to call this class a weeder because based on what Mike said about the grading, still about 75% of the people will get B's or better. So, while I'd say they hand grading pretty poorly for this class, your actual final grade probably won't be that bad as long as you are keeping up with/doing slightly better than everyone else.Are the instructors super unhelpful on campuswire?Yup. Mike uses campuswire to communicate with students, but for pretty much every question, they'll give you some super vague answer that isn't helpful. And, if you try to ask the question again, they'll just link you back to their original, vague answer instead of trying to clarify.Is Mike a horrible teacher and person?No! I can see how people can find his constant positivity annoying with how much work the class is, but I'd say Mike is a good teacher and person! His lectures and presentations are pretty good, he's pretty friendly, and despite everything, you'll probably be pretty good at R coding by the end of the course. He gives off dad humor vibes, and even though no one ever laughs at his jokes in class, I actually found them quite funny!Does the TA Jake Kramer always talk super condescendingly, delight in making problems too hard for students to do and taking off points from them, basically use discussion sections to show off stuff that he knows how to do but you can't, is literally trying 24/7 trying to catch people for cheating, and probably steals lunch money from students?x <- TRUE(honestly, if there's multiple lectures offered for your quarter for Stats 20, try to find which one has Jake as TA, and then take the other one)",2,0,NEGATIVE,0.9984927177429199

I just wanna vomit every time I see them. Anyhow, I don't want to comment on Michael because I think he is fine except those hypocritical sentences he likes to say. You can't expect everybody to teach programming like Carey Nachenberg. But here's the thing, the TA Jake Kramer is the MOST AWFUL TA I have ever met, and presumably, the WORST PERSON ever. I really don't like to judge a person when writing evaluations but every clue leads me to the conclusion that he is not only a bad TA but a bad person. It seems that he really enjoys failing students and destroys others confidence. And there is a guy who wrote a little bit more after the exam time ended, Jake refused to take his exam and even tried to stop any other TA to take his exam. Also, they gave extremely hard or tricky questions on exams and homework while not providing answers to them, BTW, you are NOT ALLOWED TO BRING CHEATSHEETS FOR A PROGRAMMING EXAM, meaning you have to memorize every bit of detail of numerous built-in functions in R. and REMEMBER, they will ask you the most tricky part of the functions and they expect you to be perfect, just like the help() function that knows every bits of detail in R. Jake likes to say ""Oh I solved this questions with only 6 lines of code"" or ""my fastest algorithm takes around 2 seconds to run"". Fine, I know you are good at R so just (*swear word) TELL US WHAT IS THE ANWER CUZ WE ARE NOT HERE TO LISTEN TO YOU BRAGGING.

This is the first programming class I have ever take that deduces you points for every tiny mistake in your style of code. Although they give you style checker, I have to spend half an hour every time checking styles before submitting the homework. This is just a waste of time and will only ruins your interest to write code when you have to always keep Jake's pedantic rules in mind. I really wanna end this comment with some good things about this class, but I just can't come up with any.

He has office hours during his normal lecture time. We had 7 homework assignments (technically 8, but the last one was optional and mostly for final prep) throughout the quarter. Each homework is graded on satisfactory completion (so even if your answer is wrong, if the grader thinks you made a good enough effort, you'll still get full points).We had a class Campuswire where the professor and TAs were fairly active on. You get extra credit for contributing to Campuswire discussions.Our final project was cancelled, which was nice.Tests are very difficult and almost everyone runs out of time. There is usually one question per test that is quite niche in the sense that you probably have never seen what is described in the problem unless you spend a lot of time experimenting around with R. If you want to do well on tests, learn how to debug code quickly, since that will take up a lot of time on tests if you aren't careful.The raw scores for the midterms were pretty low, but the professor does scale them to increase your score a little.Some stats for midterms (from the scaled scores, not the raw scores):Midterm 1: median = 61, mean = 62Midterm 2: median = 65, mean = 64I had TA Jake and I interacted with him once in week 1 and then never saw him again. I think he stopped holding discussions after the first week, and I didn't see him post any discussion recordings on CCLE either. Maybe he did post recordings and I just didn't find them, I don't know. I did watch a couple discussion recordings from the other TAs though, they seemed pretty good and they gave some nice debugging examples.This class is said to be an introductory programming class, but I would not recommend taking this class without any coding experience. There is so much material covered in so little time. If you are new to programming, be prepared to spend 10+ hours (outside of watching lecture videos) on this class per week if you want to get a good grade. If you are new to coding, have a genuine interest in coding, and want to foster that genuine interest, do NOT take this class as your first programming class.

Homework assignments took me anywhere between 3 to 8 hours a week, depending on the assignment and how much effort I wanted to put in.Towards the end of the quarter, I stopped watching lectures and just read the lecture notes, which I found more useful and time efficient.If you are new to programming or would like to understand debugging more, I would recommend going to discussion.

What this means is that you can expect to spend a good amount of time doing homework and an end-of-the-quarter project. You can also expect to see written response questions in the midterms that can usually get brutal in difficulty as well as multiple choice questions that requires extensive playing around on R to learn specific outputs.   Personally, I recommend that you take a programming class such as Python beforehand. I took C beforehand, and still managed to struggle. Then again, knowledge of C does not translate well into R (Python is somewhat more similar to R). There were also some students with no programming experience that were in better shape than I was, but they probably have better study habits than me (I don’t recommend taking multiple shots of vodka while studying). But yeah, anyways, Mike is a real kind dude and he would try his best to help out his students on Campuswire and in office hours with hints. He won’t outright tell you the answers to homework problems, as he expects you to learn by struggling, but it does give you a better sense of accomplishment when you get a difficult function to successfully run.    I’m going to be frank, I did get quite stressed with the class and I usually manage to get my stress under control during the most trying times. I’m sure a lot of other people got heavily  stressed too. The other reviews weren’t joking that there were multiple homework assignments around the time of the second midterm and the final project did get delayed until a week and a half before finals week, so that is something you will have to get prepared for. Combined that with the fact that I had a difficult Linear Algebra class to deal with and let’s just say I got pretty awful scores for my midterms and final. However, you can ask Mike if you can take your midterm at another time (I forgot to do this, oops) as he knows the period during the midterms is just downright tough.    In the end, I got a B+, and I don’t even think I deserved that grade at all. Mike was once a student like us, and graded very leniently since he knows how being a college student is a real ordeal. At the same time, he put us through quite a wild ride in this class in the hopes that we become ready for the upper division Stats classes. Because of that, I now feel ready to take on anything upper division Stats classes toss at me, and I’m optimistic that my newfound skills in R will take me far.

A lot of the homework includes things he hasn't really cover in lectures. He just throws you a function and a brief description for that and expects you to figure out by the help section in r studio (the help section includes EVERYTHING in r, so basically he expects you to know everything because you can self-learn through that help section). He really likes giving out an unmanagable amount of homework and assignments before exams. Before the second midterm, we have three homework dues, one of them is to write 26 built-in functions. That homework takes me around 10 hours to write out functions that could work 99% percent of the situations. But what Jake expects are the most perfect functions that could work for even the most rare circumstances,  and in PERFECT format, so I only get 53/100.  By the way, he deducts points for using print() function which he thinks it's undesirable. So for one function even mine works perfectly, but I get 2 points deducted just because I use a function which he doesn't like.  For thanksgiving holiday, we don't have class on Wed, but mike assigns a whole new chapter for us to self-study. Normally we spend about a week to learn a whole chapter, and mike just expects us to have enough time to self-learn a new chapter because we have one day off prior to thanksgiving. After thanksgiving is week 10, and we have another new chapter to learn, another homework for the new chapter due on week 10 Friday, and a Final Project that is SUPER HARD that takes me over 20 hours to work on which is due at the end of Final week. Mike constantly reminds us to have enough rest and enjoy our life and care about our mental health.

Also a great lecturer, I'm the type to stop going to lecture after Week 6ish but I kept going into Week 10. He really breaks down the material nicely but keeps it light like you leave the lecture not even realizing just how much you just learned. Also, laugh at his nerdy jokes, nobody in my hall did and it was super depressing because they were actually lowkey funny. The class itself is hard but manageable. Don't go into it thinking it will be easy or even medium. If you go into it knowing that you will have to learn an entire coding language from scratch (which is hard) then you will be fine. How to do well in this class? HOMEWORK, HOMEWORK, HOMEWORK. Don't leave it to the last minute. Don't copy it. Really struggle through it trust me it is better to struggle on the homework than cram before the test. Do it by yourself, not with a partner. Also, do or at least try the advanced problems, they are not required but do it anyway. The grading is beyond fair, the tests are strictly graded but the curve is generous to make up for it. It is after all, a class rank test which is annoying for other students to have to do poorly for you to look better in comparison but it's as close to fair as course like this can get.

He knows his lectures like the back of his hand and creates these organized pdfs of the material. His class was also really engaging and he managed to make me laugh in each lecture. He also teaches in a way where you can just focus on your learning without being concerned about your grade. I never found myself stressed or incentivized to cheat to do well. The homework, while challenging, is graded on completion. The exams are quite difficult, but he curves generously so it doesn't really matter in the end. Just focus on trying to learn from mistakes you make on past exams. A study hack for this class is to also play around with R commands and see how outputs change depending on different types of inputs. He literally gives you all the resources you need for the class condensed on his pdfs, so Stack overflow is entirely useless and exams never have surprises on them.

For starters you learn lots - this is inevitable as you are to be faced with loads of assignments and, well, the best way to learn anything is by getting your hands dirty.  Secondly the faculty members - the prof. and the TAs - do care about your learning experience, and this I say based on the following reasons1. Both the professor and TA (Jake for me) offer plenty of office hours (like more than any other courses I've taken). 2. They really want you to learn lots and be prepared for future endeavours; prof Mike threw in loads of outside learning materials on CCLE and Jake always went great lengths to cover more than what were covered in lectures 3. Prof Mike really does mean when he says that he cares about our mental/physical well-being. He's always willing to listen to our concerns and suggestions and takes measures when necessary... and of course, ah, the curve - the curve is the prime evidence that prof Mike really does care about your grades.For those who haven't taken yet - chances are this course is tough and you will likely be putting in heck tonnes of time on this course unless you've already got sturdy background in R.

I tried many times to try and connect with him in class, yet our conversations were always somehow awkward and ended on a weird note.

The focus on putting our health and relationships before our academics was very refreshing and something I really appreciated throughout the quarter.In terms of the structure of the class, I thought that it could’ve been better. I hated R during the first half of the quarter because it seemed very inefficient, slow, and useless. Only toward the end when we started to import data files and make pretty graphs did I see the usefulness of R. It would’ve been nice to see that at the beginning of the quarter so that I would’ve had more motivation to suffer through in the beginning. He also gave really cryptic answers to my questions about the homework, which I did not appreciate. Also, the professor is really picky about using the Tidyverse style guide, which I really hated.

No prior programming knowledge is assumed, and Dr. Mike (don't call him Professor Tsiang!) designs it such that prior knowledge of R won't even help you very much. In particular you are prohibited from using functions or structures that he hasn't yet talked about in lecture, which to me has some teaching benefits but also some drawbacks, as at times I and other students were unsure or had trouble remembering what we were and weren't allowed to use. Dr. Mike lectures in a way such that you won't just memorize a bunch of names but actively understand the theory and reasoning behind functions and structures, and his exams reflect this as they contain theoretical questions in addition to the traditional writing and debugging of code.There were no live lectures save the introductory one on the first day. This also had major benefits and drawbacks. It was nice to be able to rewind and pause when needed, but a major downside was that it was impossible to space out all the lectures so each scheduled day would have 110 minutes' worth of content. This resulted in some days having insanely short lectures while others would far surpass two hours. Likewise, the length of the weekly homeworks tended to vary significantly, and the busiest week overall (in my opinion) was the week of the midterm. However, I wouldn't blame this on poor scheduling by Dr. Mike, I think it was merely an unfortunate consequence of the weird summer schedule.Your grade consists of one midterm (two hours), the final (three hours), a final project, weekly homework (graded on satisfactory completion), and participation on Campuswire.

This class was seriously what almost broke me. I was having full on breakdowns about this class every day and my friends can tell you that I was a completely different person while taking this class. It took me so long to write this review because I didn't want to relive how stressed out I was while taking this. First of all, I ignored the reviews on Bruinwalk before taking this class and this has officially made me learn my lesson. This is the first B I've ever earned in college and as a previously 4.0 student, this was a hard blow. If you do NOT have prior coding experience or familiarity with computers, have SERIOUS CAUTION about taking this class.ABOUT THE PROFESSOR AND TA: Even though this class was literal hell, I don't have much bad to say about Dr. Tsiang. If you go to office hours, he will spend hours and hours of his time trying to help you understand. He's a likable guy and I liked that he kept his Christmas tree up in the back of his zoom calls through March lol. Additionally, he does curve grades a lot which is greatly appreciated. I really think that he's a great professor and Edouardo was a fantastic TA. However, I think they greatly underestimate the workload. I think that since this is introductory coding and they are much more experienced at coding that they don't understand how difficult this can be for beginner coders.ABOUT THE MATERIAL: I have taken calculus, biology, and chemistry classes and earned A+ in all of them so I thought that I would be okay, but coding is a whole other monster. Even though previous coding experience is not required and the professor insists that, it truly puts you at a disadvantage because coding requires a very different logic and way of thinking. ABOUT THE WORKLOAD: The workload in this class is A LOT. There are 2 midterms, a final, a final project, weekly in-depth homeworks, and participation credit through an online forum. I hate to say it, but the TA and professor both insist that the weekly homeworks should not take you more than 4 hours, but that's just frankly not the case. I spent probably 20 hours at least per week on the homeworks and that's lowballing it. The questions are never basic and require you to know the lecture material IN DEPTH and think very outside of the box other than what he's shown you to use. Also you are not allowed to have tutors outside the class.TLDR: The professor highly curves this class and is helpful and kind, but the material is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT especially if you've never had interactions with coding before. My personal experience with this class was also combined with personal emergencies that made trying to juggle both REALLY difficult and gave me some extremely dark thoughts that a class has never given me before.

She tries to make R easy to understand and learn. All the other positive reviews here speak the truth! She has so much knowledge, experience, and connections in the field of statistics, and it's clear that she cares that what we learn easily translates to marketable skills for real-life jobs and interviews. Sometimes she will mention her experiences and her past students' experiences and relate them to lectures, and then her knowledge and experience become quite clear. I suppose to some extent she is intimidating, but her lectures are clear, she encourages questions, and is very helpful during office hours. Definitely a good professor to engage with, I wish I had talked to her a bit more. The way she structures her class makes it easy to succeed as long as there is some effort, and Jake does not TA for her Stats 20 classes!--The ""Engagement"" in the grading scheme is basically participation outside of class, using Campuswire to engage with Professor Lew and the rest of the class. However, you do not actively need to post questions, answers, or responses if you don't want to as she creates a poll every week for minimum participation and simply gives full credit for participating in that alone (but if you have questions on homework Campuswire is a good place to go to).  Discussion attendance was fulfilled simply by being present at discussion sections, and our TA Eric Fischer allowed us to attend whichever discussion fit best into our schedule regardless of which one we were officially enrolled in. He basically spent the time answering any homework questions and clarifying concepts people were confused about, and this helped quite a lot.--""Lessons"" were our homework assignments and the lowest 3 were dropped. On each lesson page, she gives some examples of the types of things we are expected to know how to program and then asks some questions which we have to write solutions to in R Markdown. These vary in difficulty but any confusion could be clarified by the TA in discussion or by someone on Campuswire who had figured out a solution. Labs were basically assignments related to an ongoing project over the quarter. The final product was a Shiny app made using a dataset she gave us, which had to have some type of output such as a graph or map in response to user input. I think her Spring Quarter class did this project in groups and had slightly higher expectations, but she allows more flexibility and ease for Summer Session since there's less time and it's not done in groups. The final is modeled on a technical interview and is open for 27 hours. It isn't necessarily super easy, but as long as you have been properly keeping up with the material and the lessons you should be able to produce reasonable solutions to the prompt on the final.--Overall I would highly recommend Professor Lew for Stats 20. She's kind, clear, and engaging. She structures her teaching around teaching us useful skills, and she tries to make it so anyone can succeed.

As programming isn’t quite my cup of tea, I feel behind a lot of the smart people on the lab midterm, which was very punishing to those who knew the solution yet messed up the answer due to mistyping, small logic errors, etc. I managed to crush the lecture midterm though, since Professor Lew threw out questions that were on the unfair side and I had a good grasp of how the code should be structured.Things took a turn for the better during the later half of the course. Stuff made more sense, and the labs weren’t that bad (though the ggplot2 lab was quite a beast).

Finally, Professor Lew REALLY emphasizes the outside world and prepping you for technical interviews. Try not to ask her really small questions that you can find the answer to yourself, as she’s super busy.

Average grade for the midterm was 55%. This was because of a combination of very poor lecturing  (as mentioned above),  an unreasonably long test as well as the fact that the homeworks and textbook are all based on R, so before the midterm you are spending 99% of your time learning the material on R whereas th test is all by hand, which causes a lot of problems. Finally, the grading of the course. I believe the grades for this course were largely fabricated. I’m not sure how anyone got away with this but in one of the homeworks, I did not answer an entire section and got 100%, as did everyone else who handed it in (you can see this on the grade distribution on myUCLA).

A couple examples of non-related and non-helpful homeworks include one where you had to record an interview of you with another student about how probability was relevant in your major and another one where we had to submit a 2-page biographical paper on a historical mathematician in the field of probability. She hands out worksheets in lecture as opposed to discussion and has you talk to group members in the middle of lecture, so you can't even skip those even though they're borderline useless. The questions she asks are usually unclear or very poorly worded, and on top of that she can be eccentric to a fault - on our timed midterm, there was a question with a link to a YouTube video of a parody of 'Someone You Loved' by Lewis Capaldi with probability models, where the question was ""which probability model was not mentioned in the video?""

Our distributions were how you'd expect them to be for a stats class with this large of a syllabus for 10 weeks.- She did offer EC opportunities but those were in the form of more quizzes, which I was done with and did not attempt (to be exact I attempted 20% of ONE quiz out of 10).- Her grading scale was that you needed a 95% for an A, so if you were not on top of your game from Day 1, you're likely going to heavily depend on a thick curve for one of the tests.Finally,Take this class if you have to, its not unbearable if you are passionate about stats and need it as a prereq for more computational upper-divs. But if this class is one of four, maybe five classes in the quarter and you just want to explore the field...hold it off for the next quarter.",1,0,POSITIVE,0.9696734547615051

The workload was significant but not over the top - a homework packet of 5-9 questions each week (most but not all a/b/c/d, sometimes to h) and usually assignments to turn in the next day in lecture (you have to check CCLE because sometimes she didn't remind us to do it). Sometimes gives pop quizzes in the middle of the lecture (off her powerpoint point slides she would have an example of the day's topic for us to work on and hand in our work, but only once or twice did she grade on correctness. It was more like participation even if wrong). That's about it for work; one midterm is multiple choice, the second is free response, and the final was mostly multiple choice with a little free response. Warning that she never gave enough time so you have to work fast. Sometimes she got rid of questions after realizing how long the tests were though.Her exams are open note - first midterm we were allowed one page of formulas, second midterm and final were open notebook. Don't be fooled though, you barely have enough time to glance at notes so it's not super helpful unless you already know everything.The good thing I noticed about the class that I was surprised about is how nice and available she usually was. She holds a lot of office hours and doesn't make you feel stupid for asking simple questions, and we usually had a lot of them because her lectures are way too fast. But another thing is that she records all her lectures and posts them online so I usually went back to watch them. The complaints that she takes attendance every lecture for participation, and the complaints of her exam rituals are fairly accurate - she seemed obsessed with cheating and had us take lots of precautions for every test. She did in fact have a lot of typos in lecture notes and even in her textbook so hopefully your lecture will have a smart person to call them out.

You end up not really learning what you did, and just working with friends/copying neighbors/writing gibberish just to get an answer(it's usually okay to ""work in groups"").The worst part is that for her finals, she'll randomly tell you that for some of the questions, ""Choose the answer closest to your answer.""

Here are the ""good"" and ""not-so-good"" parts of her class.The good: Overall, Dr. Sanchez was very helpful. She replied to emails almost instantly, and her expectations for the most part were reasonable. The nice part was that her class is very structured (she tells you EXACTLY what you need to do every week and forces you to keep up with the material), so it was hard to fall behind. Overall, lecture videos were clear and polished.The ""not-so-good"": Workload became very heavy at times, and expectations for homework often times were unclear and vague. The Cognella active quizzes and review assignments could at times be a real time sink, since many of the assignments contained more than 20 questions, often times with multiple parts (a),(b),(c) etc. On top of that, Dr. Sanchez assigns weekly homework, which she claims helps you apply knowledge of probability to the real world. This is a fantastic idea, only that Dr. Sanchez provides very little guidance on how to obtain relevant statistical data and research papers for us to analyze. Due to her unclear and vague instructions, I wasted tons of time searching on the web for those data. Also, some of her homework feels like busy work. She once made us make a video explaining the biography of a probabilist of our choice (how is this relevant to what we're learning?). Grading at times can be harsh, as some reviewers have mentioned. The 3-hour timed midterm was not difficult per se, but the grading was super picky. I kept losing 0.2 points per problem for ""not clearly defining random variable"" and ""not checking assumptions for binomial.""...etc. , even though I answered the questions correctly and showed work and explanation.

It is definitely possible to succeed in her class, especially if you read her instructions carefully and follow them to a T on the assignments. That being said, her class is a challenge, not because of the subject matter, but because Dr. Sanchez can be strict in ways you aren't used to (including grading). Also, she said in the beginning of the quarter that a 95 is needed for an A, and 98 for an A+, but I believe she ended up curving.

Having experienced her unbelievably confusing and ambiguous midterm questions, I and many others chose to do the data project thinking it’d give us some semblance of control over our grades. I spent more time working on part one of this project than I normally do studying for a hard final. Checked my grade a week later: 50%. Highest score in the class was a 60%. WTF.

You had better follow her specifications or, as a nice evaluation below puts it, points off for every little minor fucking detail...like your assignment # not being in the correct place or a badly stapled paper. I also should mention that the typos are strong with this one. Difficulty wise it is not too bad. Her exam administration is undoubtedly the best part though. 50 minute exam? More like 25 because she takes 15 minutes to take roll call (YES ROLL CALL !! WHICH PROFESSOR TAKES ROLL CALL DURING EXAM TIME?!) and will end the exam 10 minutes early with no warning. Final exam? 35 minutes to take roll call and ended 10 minutes early with no warning. Seating is also retarded. On the first exam we had to sit in a very tight formation in a classroom where a plethora of seats were available....just so that she could walk around the exam room and check your ID 4 times (YES 4 TIMES!!). Next exam and final was the usual one space in between.

Can't use that desk or even the floor because it's ""cheating"". Yup it's going to be a balancing act on one desk and your knee ladies and gentlemen. The exams themselves? I would recommend going through all practice exams and homeworks to memorize the answers to every multiple choice question. My friend and I managed to answer 11 out of 43 MC questions on the final in 45 seconds. Some of these questions required an immense amount of calculation that could have easily eaten away almost 10 minutes or more if there was an error in punching in numbers at any point. I also should mention that some questions have identical answer choices (A and C could literally be the exact same answer) while some questions may not even HAVE a correct answer (not mentioned on the error sheet she gave us). Our final, which was initially out of 51 points, got reduced to 47. How ironic....I stumbled across 4 questions that did not seem to have a correct answer while taking the exam myself...hmm....You can probably imagine how long students could waste on these questions trying to figure out why their answer is not there.Overall, this professor intentionally and unintentionally through ridiculous policies and sheer incompetency makes this class more tedious than it needs to be.

You should either print them ahead of time or use a tablet.His book? Some equations are written WITHIN paragraphs which make it very hard to read.

However, he often links questions, and you can back solve the first answer using the answers from the previous question. He also doesn’t try to trip you up by purposefully putting potentially confusing answers (like he doesn’t think of a common mistake that you’ll make on a question and make that the answer choice – your choices are going to be the answer, and then three random, similar numbers). So that’s really nice and it definitely saved me on a couple questions. The actual statistics part is quite easy, and the hard questions came from thinking about poker. That’s the best and the worst part of the class. Is it fun to watch a lot of poker and do poker problems? Yes. But the questions can get pretty convoluted. One question was something along the lines of probability of a full house or a straight on the turn or not making a pair with board cards and your hole cards (but you can make a pair on the board), so questions could get pretty confusing. However, the exams are multiple choice, and they’re OPEN BOOK OPEN NOTE. Honestly, it was a life saver, it meant you had to study so much less. There are also questions pretty much straight from his slides, so I don’t understand why people just didn’t print out his slides and bring them to the exam, because you can literally just copy the methodology from his slides and change the numbers. The exams aren’t as easy as previous years, but they’re still not that hard since they’re open book open note. Over 50% of people got a 100 on the first exam, around 50% got a 90% above on the second midterm (plus he gave us extra credit on that one), and the final was the hardest of them all, but still straight forward, just a couple tricky ones based on thinking about poker. However, if you’re not good at poker, don’t be discouraged because you have to know the very basics, and the hard part is just having to think of all the different possibilities that you could have. Class is optional, but he goes over questions that will be on the exams that he purposefully doesn’t put on the slides that he’ll put on exams. Plus, it’s fun to watch the poker hands, I actually really got into high stakes poker. Slides are very well-organized and well done. Textbook is optional, and he actually wrote the textbook, but if you want it in exams, then you need to buy it. I found a lot of good practice problems from the textbook, so I definitely recommend getting a copy as it’s not egregiously overpriced. Overall, highly recommend the course.

Luckily, our TA literally gave us the solutions to them, otherwise I can garuntee 1/4 of the class would have failed every assignment. The group project was also a huge mess (like the rest of the course) with very little guidance. There was little to gain through it and it just added to a very high workload. Now, onto the midterm. Average grade for the midterm was 55%. This was because of a combination of very poor lecturing (as mentioned above), an unreasonably long test as well as the fact that the homeworks and textbook are all based on R, so before the midterm you are spending 99% of your time learning the material on R whereas th test is all by hand, which causes a lot of problems. Finally, the grading of the course. I believe the grades for this course were largely fabricated.

I would take some notes during lecture and know that I am processing new information but then wasn't even sure what it was that I was doing. The content of the class isn't very difficult but Gould made it difficult. 1. He goes through his slides too fast. I stopped taking notes at one point because half the time I was just writing ""see lecture slides"" since I didn't have time to write anything down (he does post them on CCLE). He also seems to be using slides he made a few years ago and doesn't remember what's on them. It seemed like the next slide was always a surprise to him and he was learning along with the rest of the class. 2. His homework assignments are terribly constructed. There were often typos that made it hard to understand and the wording allowed for multiple interpretations. My friend went into office hours to get clarifications and Gould said her approach was completely wrong and the other students had thought the same as her. When Gould saw that all the students clearly didn't know what to do, he did nothing. He didn't post on CCLE or Campuswire or anything. So basically if you can't go to office hours you will not be able to do the homework assignments. The assignments are also graded extremely harsh. There might be 5 questions each with parts a-e and if I got one part of one question wrong I would get 10-20% off. I got a 50% on an assignment where I had 3 small errors. If you're wondering, he gave one assignment per week due Fridays at 6pm. The only problem with this is that our last lecture ended Thursday at 4:45pm. And most of the time you couldn't finish the homework until after the Thursday lecture because he teaches material for it. So you have to figure out the homework in 24 hours with no office hours in that time to help. Just Campuswire which Gould rarely went on to answer questions, and there were a lot of questions. 3. His final is EASY. It's a take home exam that you have a week to complete and I finished it in a couple of hours. So don't worry too much about your midterm or homework grades because I guarantee everyone is struggling but the final will save you.4. Don't read the book. You need it for some homework problems but I think there's a free PDF somewhere. Overall I would not take a class with Gould again.

While sometimes he might not be the most clear in explaining some of the material (particularly the chapter 7 stuff about estimators), he will always be willing to help clarify things to you after class or in his office hours with a big smile. Also, he has a random sign in sheet he passes around sometimes and if you have attended every lecture when the sign up sheet was passed around, you get a flat 2% added to your final grade which is pretty huge. His exams are rather straight forward and on the easier side, the only remotely tricky parts are the few multiple choice / true/false questions he has on every exam. Other than that, the exams are open everything short of a laptop, so you don't need to spend time committing formulas and test procedures exactly to memory.

Juana Sanchez is single-handedly the worst professor I've ever had at UCLA. Of course after 20 years of teaching, the rumors about how awful she is would make one initially hesitant to enroll in the class. However, she was the only professor Spring 2018, and I had to endure it with her. To give you some context, there were over 100 kids enrolled week 1, and during the final there were only 53 kids. OVER 50 KIDS DROPPED THIS COURSE. If this doesn't scare you, please keep reading.  During the first lecture on week 1, we were given a pop quiz that counted for a grade. On her syllabus, she makes ""participation"" worth 8% , and the final worth 35%. If you chose, you can opt out of the in-class participation exercises and make your final 43%. I'm telling you now, this is a TRAP. And it was the first of many I experienced over 10 weeks. Do not drop the participation to make your final worth more, because the final is so anxiety-inducing. To give you an idea of how awful the homework assignments were, she would make you copy-and-paste code from R into a CCLE portal (instead of a rendered HTML or PDF like a normal professor). But if your code had ANY errors at all, she gives you a 0. In terms of the exams, Sanchez puts WAY TOO MANY QUESTIONS for anyone to finish in 50 minutes. Her testing policies are neurotic, and yes, she will read every word on your cheat sheet to make sure it follows ALL of her arbitrary rules.  The midterm exams (each worth 23.5% of your grade) are a mix of MC, written response, and analyzing code. She will ask you to read through a page of code and point out ALL of the errors in the code AND fix them. (How was anyone supposed to do this??) Also, proofs are not off limits, and she won't hesitate to ask you for a proof on the exam! (Eyeroll) When it comes to exams, she also gives you the most inconvenient matricies to multiply. We had to multiply a (4x4) and a (4x1) BY HAND. To make it worse, each value had three decimal places. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the exam is that she is very stingy with partial credit. Each exam question is only ONE POINT. So each exam is /15 points. (If you get two MC question wrong, you're already at a B, and it's worth 23.5%). To put things into further perspective, a 95% is a solid A. 94 or below is an A- . I bet you're wondering how the final exam could possibly be worse. Well, to answer that question: IT WAS ENTIRELY CODING. 100% of the final exam was done in R in a computer lab where we had to code algorithms to data sets she gave us. If you are not a strong programmer- this class is not for you. The final was open note (the only redeeming quality of this class), but the exam averages were awful throughout the quarter. The exam averages were: Exam 1) 57%, Exam 2) 61% , Final) 61% . Personally, I did above avg on one exam, slightly below avg on the other, and scored pretty well on the final, but somehow ended with a B- and do not think I deserved it at all. The smartest friends I had in that class also ended with a B- and I do not know anyone who earned a higher grade. 25/53 kids failed the final exam, so there is a high chance that ~50% of this class received a C+ or lower (just a rough estimate given my personal exam scores). If you are still somehow not convinced she is the WORST professor on this campus, keep reading buddy! On top of these awful exams and homeworks, she also is EXTREMELY patronizing and rude during lecture. She walks around the room while she lectures and actually kicked backpacks to walk through the aisles. I'm not exaggerating when I say almost every set of slides / worksheets she gave us had errors in them. Her lecturing style is very unorganized also. She scribbles all over the board illegibly, and does not post her handwritten notes online. There were SEVERAL instances where we would get emails from her saying ""found an error in the notes, please correct it"" and sometimes she wouldn't even tell us what the error was.  She also frequently keeps you over the 50 minute lecture time. The only reason I got through this class was because the TA was decent. For someone who has been teaching for 20 years at UCLA, I find this all absolutely unacceptable. There is no amount of psychological counseling that can help one cope with the bullshit she puts you through for ten weeks. Absolutely avoid this class at all costs. If you are thinking about taking any other class with her, keep this in mind. She truly does not give a FUCK about any of her students- even the ones who show up nearly in tears to office hours.

She is without a doubt the most ineffective lecturer I have had the unfortunate chance to encounter at UCLA. Let me give you a rundown of just how horrible this class.1) Lecture NotesShe assigns a bundle of lecture notes that is plagued with mistakes and typos. She is so severely disorganized that in week 8, she gave us a handout and told us to toss the one she gave in the last class altogether because it every page was filled with typos. 2) ParticipationShe made a ""participation"" thing optional for students who don't want their final grade to account for ~40% of his/her final grade. She requires us to ""participate"" in almost every lecture. The amount of ""participation"" she makes her students go through on top of the homework as he assigns (I'll get back to that later) is ridiculous. Some participations, such as the one that requires you to look for the k-means, can take 1-2 hours. Also, she is very vain with grading. In one unfortunate occasion, I wrote Var(Cx) and just started calculating the variance-covariance matrix. I got 0.7/1.0 even though the answer was right because I didn't write Var(Cx) again. I asked her for my 0.3 back since technically the answer is correct and I showed her all the steps, her response was ""0.7 is not a bad grade"". 3) ExamsHer exams are the worst. The amount of material she wants to cover in a 50 minutes examination is ridiculous. She had multiple choice questions for both midterm 1 and 2 and required us to ""give an explanation"" to our choice. My explanation for the 2nd midterm wasn't enough so she ducked 0.5 points off even though my answer was correct. She also makes us go through lines of codes and highlight things. I was unsure of what she wanted us to highlight for midterm 1 for the confidence interval code. I rewrote the section of the code manually. Turns out, she just wanted the numerical solution. She held a cumulative midterm for the second midterm, which she held, a day after Memorial Day weekend ON week 9. My friends and I thought the questions would build on each other, I mean that's what professors usually do? Instead, she explicitly tests us on materials before midterm 1, EVEN though she also explicitly tests us on post-midterm 1 material. I am unsure of what she is trying to achieve by employing this technique.She made us ""Code"" on the final and required us to code about ~4/5 questions in 2 hours.  It was lengthy, difficult and time consuming. Side note: In week 10, she introduced us to Gibbs sampling/MCMC/etc. 2/5 of the final examination questions required us to code the material she introduced in week 10, which she failed to explain and give us sufficient exercises on.4) HomeworksEvery other Statistics professor at UCLA that I have encountered require us to Knit our homework to pdf/html. Juana Sanchez, is unfortunately, an outlier. She requires us to use an Rscript and copy paste our code to CCLE. On top of the difficult coding assignments that she just throws at us, she would require us to comment on everything and have it compiled with NO ERROR. She doesn't even give us partial credit on anything with an error. Well, if she wants an error-less chunk of code, why doesn't she implement a pdf/html submission??? 5) Final GradeThe final grade my friends and I got in this class was ridiculous. Some of my friends ""aced"" the final by scoring way above the curve and ended up with a B-. I scored right above the mean during the final, below the mean during the second midterm and above the mean for the second and ended up with a C. Does this mean 50% of the class got C or worse?? Isn't this a reflection of how she failed as an instructor?Fun fact: 50% of the class dropped after midterm 1. But since she is the ONLY instructor for spring and it isn't offered again until Spring 2019, I had no choice but to endure her.I could go on and on about how this class was the absolute worst for students' mental health and learning experience but I would like to move on with my life.  I just wanted to say one more thing, I came to UCLA  because I wanted to learn and was open to the idea of making mistakes. The material for 102B was actually interesting. I spent some of my free time reading about it. But her way of teaching makes it SO DIFFICULT to appreciate the material or take away anything meaningful from the class.

Ask again, threatens to take points off.She also ignores email SENT outside business hours. So essentially, if you can't find her in her office, then you won't find her via email either!

He clearly cares about his students A LOT but is an ineffective lecturer. Each slide show presentation he uses during class is  at least 80 slides long and are a complete mess. Reviewing them is often of no use due to their sheer length and lack of information (it’s actually amazing that he is able to make a slideshow presentation this long that is void of any informative content). During class, he brushes over information, doesn’t explain concepts at all and most of the time, people are sitting there lost, wondering “WTF is this guy talking about?” I have never once left and if his lectures and been able to tell you what he was taking about, never mind actually understanding what he was talking about. He NEEDS to begin structuring his thoughts and learn to maintain a clear train of thought for the sake of his students.  Homework assignments all require the use of R and aren’t too bad, they can just be long. The only work that requires calculations to be carried out by hand are the midterm and final, which means you don’t get any formal practice carrying out equations by hand before the midterm and final, which is frustrating. The layout of the midterm and final is also messy with screenshots taken from R which can hinder your performance in the exam. The calculations required if you during the midterm are LONG and tedious. Completing an ANOVA table takes a lot of time and drawing factor diagrams for a repeated measures experiment is an art in itself. These tests are not easy to complete in the allotted time.Note: I completed this course during the coronavirus  pandemic and the George Floyd riots so the final was able to be completed over 3 days so I’m not sure if it is representative of what his normal exams are like. The midterm was completed over an hour and 20 minutes as normal and it was hard to finish in time. There is a group project which I actually enjoyed a lot. I had a great group which was very motivating and we really worked well together. I feel sorry for those who weren’t so lucky in this regard.Quizzes contain content from lower division STAT courses so they’re OK if you still remember the content from those classes.I found the way to succeed in this course is to expect that you’re not going to get much out of the actual lectures. For me, the best method was to read the relevant textbook chapters, take note of the equations (eg all the sum of squares formulae etc) and complete as many practice questions as you can possibly do. Receiving a reply to an email you sent to  Almohalwas is a game of luck. You might receive a reply almost immediately or you might not receive one at all! Im I’ve received a reply to 2 out of the approx. 10 emails I’ve sent him during the duration of his class.  I think someone should start a betting ring about his emails. He will release quizzes and homework's on CCLE without sending out emails so you best be on your toes!All in all, taking a class with Almohalwas is an experience.

He clearly cares about his students A LOT but is an ineffective lecturer. Each slide show presentation he uses during class is at least 80 slides long and are a complete mess. Reviewing them is often of no use due to their sheer length and lack of information (it’s actually amazing that he is able to make a slideshow presentation this long that is void of any informative content). During class, he brushes over information, doesn’t explain concepts at all and most of the time, people are sitting there lost, wondering “WTF is this guy talking about?” I have never once left and if his lectures and been able to tell you what he was taking about, never mind actually understanding what he was talking about. He NEEDS to begin structuring his thoughts and learn to maintain a clear train of thought for the sake of his students.Homework assignments all require the use of R and aren’t too bad, they can just be long. The only work that requires calculations to be carried out by hand are the midterm and final, which means you don’t get any formal practice carrying out equations by hand before the midterm and final, which is frustrating. The layout of the midterm and final is also messy with screenshots taken from R which can hinder your performance in the exam. The calculations required if you during the midterm are LONG and tedious. Completing an ANOVA table takes a lot of time and drawing factor diagrams for a repeated measures experiment is an art in itself. These tests are not easy to complete in the allotted time.Note: I completed this course during the coronavirus pandemic and the George Floyd riots so the final was able to be completed over 3 days so I’m not sure if it is representative of what his normal exams are like. The midterm was completed over an hour and 20 minutes as normal and it was hard to finish in time.There is a group project which I actually enjoyed a lot. I had a great group which was very motivating and we really worked well together. I feel sorry for those who weren’t so lucky in this regard.Quizzes contain content from lower division STAT courses so they’re OK if you still remember the content from those classes.I found the way to succeed in this course is to expect that you’re not going to get much out of the actual lectures. For me, the best method was to read the relevant textbook chapters, take note of the equations (eg all the sum of squares formulae etc) and complete as many practice questions as you can possibly do.Receiving a reply to an email you sent to Almohalwas is a game of luck. You might receive a reply almost immediately or you might not receive one at all! Im I’ve received a reply to 2 out of the approx. 10 emails I’ve sent him during the duration of his class. I think someone should start a betting ring about his emails. He will release quizzes and homework's on CCLE without sending out emails so you best be on your toes!All in all, taking a class with Almohalwas is an experience.

Tests are always fair though, as long as you take decent notes during class and understand formulas of the slides. Grades are broken down by homework, 3 pretty simple quizzes, midterm, final, and the island project.As for the *dreaded* island project, there wasn't much guidance nor expectations given on how to tackle it, and because he didn't release information on any of the prior steps to the project itself, you only get to hear feedback on your experiment's topic AFTER the presentation is given, which by this is too late to make the significant changes that he expects.

It's easy to miss something and lose points, but you could ask the professor on Campuswire for anything you're not sure about.Midterm was a timed quiz on CCLE, reasonable in difficulty but also not very long, so getting a single problem wrong could greatly affect your score. No final exam, but there was instead a final project done in groups of 2 or 3 that involved planning, running, and analyzing an experiment. The final project again suffered from the same clarity issue as the homeworks and the average score was somewhere in the 70s, which would be an issue since the class isn't curved. The grade brackets were specified in the syllabus and not particularly generous.",0,0,NEGATIVE,0.9582686424255371

Never did I think that I would still deal with so much incompetence from a professor beyond undergraduate studies. I have great difficulty understanding Xu due to his incredibly thick accent, and his hushed tone of voice when he speaks. I have sat in the front of lectures on multiple occasions, but I still have had many issues with comprehending him. His assigned reading is useless, despite me having dedicated hours to the work, and his homework is very difficult to complete as he does not provide the necessary tools for success. Instead, I have had to Google several bits of information for my homework, information that Xu did not go over during class, and even then I would receive a score equal to that of a D. Keep in mind, the class average for the midterm was 20/40, and Xu does not believe in giving Cs. This gates students from earning class credit even if they took the steps to secure at least a 70% out of 100%. All in all, my experiences with Professor Xu have been completely disappointing, and I am at a loss as to why he is allowed anywhere near academia. Xu does not possess the skill to communicate, and share information with students.

Is that not the whole point of studying the homework? There is zero transparency in this class and Professor Wu's teaching model is to just lecture and assign work. There is no consideration for students' progress and whether or not the previous lessons were actually effective. The way he teaches was more suitable to an online course, since his lectures are so unclear I would've had to rewatch them multiple times just to understand the objective of the lecture. I would have liked to look to the slides for help with homework, but the slides are equally unhelpful since they only contain the most basic algorithms and examples, but rarely information about how to apply them in different contexts. I also found the notation pretty confusing and I personally had to spend a lot of extra time watching Professor Chen's STATS 102C lectures (posted on Youtube) to understand the lecture and the intuition behind many of the sampling and integration methods.

Since homework tended to be more complicated than lectures, I felt like I had to self-learn a lot using the textbook.

I got A- in 102A bc it was online and I didn't really attend the classes much...He focuses a lot on mathematical (or theoretical part of) statistics, so you will see lots of derivations, proofs and the math heavy stuff in his class. If you don't like the theoretical part of statistics, then you probably will suffer in Wu's class, and I would highly recommend you to take Miles Chen or other professor's classes instead.

She was a wonderful lecturer and valued student participation. She was very sweet and understanding of students' circumstances. She was also very approachable, so if you ever have an issue, communicate with her and she will probably be able to accommodate you. Because there were so many students, it sometimes felt intimidating to speak up but the class was great nonetheless. The grade is composed of 10 online quizzes (lowest two dropped), 5 lab assignments (lowest one dropped), two exams, a final project, and extra credit.Online quizzes: These quizzes opened on Fridays and closed on Sunday nights. They were all open book and multiple choice. If you had your slides in front of you, had good notes, and understood how to work through the problem, it was not too hard to get 100%. I will admit that the quizzes did get somewhat harder towards the end of the quarter but that was to be expected. Also, if you got a bad grade on one of the quizzes, it would be dropped. I think the quizzes were really fair and I appreciated her dropping two of them.Lab: Labs were entirely guided by the TA. During lab, you learn how to code using R. Personally, I thought everything was well-paced and if I ever fell behind, I could just rewatch the lab section (my TA recorded his lab section). I also found it helpful to go to my TA’s office hours if I had any questions about the lab. From what I know, most stats 10 TAs are good at getting back to/helping students. The labs are due every two weeks and are definitely not the hardest part of this course. As a person who has never used code before, I think it wasn't too bad (especially because the TAs were so helpful).Exams: The highest scored exam is worth 30% of your grade while the second best score is worth 20% of your grade. The exams were definitely the hardest part of this course. On both exams, I only missed 4-6 questions and ended up with B’s. The exams usually consist of only 30-36 questions, so missing one can already take a toll on your grade. However, what I think really helped was having 15 pages of notes with me during the exam. The exam was not open book or open note, but she allowed you to print 15 pages (double-sided) of information to bring with you for the exam. As for any advice, I would suggest getting a reliable calculator and taking thorough notes from the slides. Even though I got two B’s, I still ended the class with a pretty good grade.Final Project: You can work in a group or you can work alone. I would suggest working in a group because, even though it is not too much work, I think it’s more efficient. The project is based on your understanding of R so getting advice from a TA would be very helpful.Extra credit: The ec can give you a 1% grade bump. You get 0.1% extra credit every time you answer a clicker question during lecture. It doesn’t have to be the right answer, you just have to show that you participated. Doing this is what bumped my grade from an A- to an A so I highly recommend doing it.",3,0,POSITIVE,0.9997921586036682

I actually wound up getting a C+ on the midterm to my surprise because I really thought I understood the concepts. I guess the questions were just really tricky. The class does deal with such a wide range of content that I found it very hard to keep up. I also felt like I didn't have as many rights as a student because I didn't have time to go to office hours and find out what I did wrong, so I'll never know. Also, nobody really wanted to speak up in class because it's just such an awkward atmosphere with like 200 people in the room. This was by far my toughest class this quarter, and I guess it made me realize math just isn't for me. I bet a lot of math majors take this course and so they wind up doing well, but I thought I try my hand at it being an arts major, and I guess it was my mistake. It was too fast for me and there was just too much going on. Perhaps if there was less going on, then I would've done a lot better. I'm not sure how this really applies to anything I'm doing but I really tried in this course and that's more than most people can say. There are weekly quizzes which are simple and straightforward and the labs are pretty easy as well, just make sure you go to discussion. It's the two examinations that are tough since each is weighted 30% and there are only 29 questions which means you can't miss a lot. You do get a sheet of paper to write down the formulas but you also want to make sure you write the definitions of the concepts. The slides are pretty dense, so make sure you understand the content on their as best as you can. Another qualm I had with this class is that the professor's voice is pretty annoying. She can't help it, but to me it sounded like an alarm clock that would not stop. I felt bad for her because she must have vocal fry after speaking with that much inflection over time.

Ms. Cha’s spoken and written communication are both difficult to understand and lacking in sophistication.

I’m a freshman who’d never taken a stats class before and found this class very easy to follow, and if you’ve taken AP Stats it’ll probably be even easier. This quarter for online learning she did half synchronous lectures (on Tuesdays) and half asynchronous lectures (on Thursdays). I liked this format as it allowed for some flexibility for the Thursday lessons and also made it so we weren’t doing the same thing over and over for every lesson each week.Participation in synchronous lectures was easy, you just had to answer poll questions she presented during class and you didn’t even have to get the answer right. With the asynchronous lectures, you had to answer questions intermittently throughout the lesson on CCLE, and these also felt pretty easy to me. Quizzes were untimed, multiple choice, and fairly similar to her examples from the lecture. Labs were easy as long as you followed along with your TA as they coded in R to answer the questions. The exams were completely multiple choice, 30 questions long, non-cumulative, and reasonable to complete within the time limit. The project was a new assignment she was trying for this quarter and it took a bit of effort, but since you were allowed to work in groups of up to 5, it was easy enough to spread out the work. If she keeps doing the project in future quarters, make sure you pay attention to labs/rewatch the recordings of labs/save your code from labs as you do have to use R on the project.

It really helped me understanding concepts that were sometimes unclear in lecture. I think that really helped me do well on the exams too.The course has about 8 quizzes, 6-7 homework assignments assigned weekly, 2 midterms, and a final. Don't worry about the labs either - they're really easy and they can be interesting at times.Only the lazy people will get anything less than a B+. I highly recommend this class - take it!

Easy to obtain a full score as long as you avoid silly mistakes. Try completing the homework before your discussion so that your TA can help you with any problems that you have.10% Labs: 5 Labs, lowest is dropped. Also quite easy but a little annoying because you have to use the software on the desktops in the computer lab so you can’t miss lab sessions (unless you buy the software yourself).20% Quizzes: 2 quizzes a week, each quiz takes 5 to 15 minutes. Mostly MCQs, occasionally a simple calculation. You get a second attempt for every quiz and the portal literally tells you what the correct answers are after the first attempt. Make sure you do the quizzes properly because the midterm and final have very similar questions. You eventually lose access to the quizzes.

I didn't bother making one.1% Clicker: Your answer doesn’t matter as long as you click on something. You’re allowed to skip two lectures though.4% Participation: Everyone gets this 4% initially. The professor randomly calls out names during some lectures. If you’re not there once, nothing happens. If you’re not there twice then you lose the participation points.

The slides were kinda all over the place. Attendance is mandatory and marked with iClicker, but clicker Q's are actually useful for exam studying. Also, I wish that he had gone over more problem solving in class for the homework.HOMEWORK: Assigned weekly from the textbook. Only five problems are graded. The problems weren't difficult, but again, he doesn't really go over problem solving during lecture. Luckily, many of the solutions can be found within the chapter reading.  Graders can also be picky, so go to OH if you want to check your answers. There's a lab quiz at the end of the quarter that also factors into your homework grade, which just requires basic knowledge of using the lab software.TEXTBOOK: Actually read it. You'll have to anyways to complete the weekly quizzes and do the homework. You're assigned roughly a chapter per week. The readings are not long at all, and I found them to be super helpful and interesting. ALSO, I took really good notes from the textbook (notice headers, boxed/starred information), which I later used to make my exam cheat sheets- all the info I needed to answer the exam questions ended up being on my cheat sheets, so this is one of the very few times that I would actually recommend studying from the textbook over lecture slides.LABS: I didn't bother attending my lab section because 1) it was at 8 am and 2) you don't really need to. You only need to show up once at the beginning of the quarter to figure out how the heck to log onto the computers (write your log-in credentials on your phone!!!) and at the end of the quarter to take the lab quiz. I ended up buying the Fathom software for $5 online so I could do the labs at home. You're required to buy the lab manual ($6) at the bookstore, and it contains all the instructions and questions to complete the lab.QUIZZES: Two quizzes each week based on textbook readings, due before each lecture, done on the MyLab Statistics website. They were usually ~5 (super easy) questions with 30 min to complete, but you can typically finish them in <5 min lol. You can also take the quiz twice, and it's the same exact questions, so there is really no excuse to get nothing short of 100% for quiz points. Also, it's 25% of your grade (!!!) so this can easily boost your grade.EXAMS: Midterm format was essentially all MC + one free response. The free response is not long or difficult at all, and Gould gives you prep ahead of time. Final was all MC, and the material was just a tad more difficult than the midterm, so focus on doing well on the midterm. I wasn't sure on what to expect for his exams at first since he does not give you practice material (sad!), but you only need the homework problems, clicker Q's, and weekly quiz questions to review. If you can follow along his lectures, have an idea of what's going on in the textbook, AND know how to solve the homework problems, you'll probably do fine, since there aren't any curveball questions on the exams. You get a 8.5x11"" cheat sheet (front & back) for both the midterm and final.*General tips to succeed in this class*1) Do the textbook reading and take extremely good notes2) Get those easy quiz points3) Understand big concepts in textbook4) Learn how to solve the homework problems without helpI did not spend too much studying for this class weekly because the content was not meant to be difficult and smart study habits can go a long way.

He posts surveys after each midterm and at the end of the course because he genuinely wants feedback about how he is doing (these are separate from the class evaluations).

Midterms were a combination of multiple choice and short answer, and the final was strictly multiple choice. The questions are straightforward assuming you understand the concepts he presents, which he outlines thoroughly. He allows a cheat sheet for the midterm and the final. As a word of caution, just because this is the case, you can't bank on writing down everything and going into the exam. You need to understand the concepts and just use the cheat sheet as a reinforcement. He also drops the lowest lab assignment and the lowest homework assignment. He says in the syllabus that ""at least 10% will get A's"" which might seem intimidating, but the key word here is ""at least.""

He's a very fair professor and tests you on what he lectures on in class. His lectures are not dull, but if you have a short attention span (I know I do) they can get boring as he reiterates the same points over and over, which for some students in the class is absolutely necessary.The homework was far more difficult than the exams in my opinion, and the guy who grades the homework is neither the professor or the TAs which I find incredibly strange. The homework is not graded very fairly though in my opinion, as some people can write down virtually the same answers and get different scores on homework. There is a little too much homework for my liking, but it's definitely manageable. The lowest score on homework gets dropped.The midterm exams were fair. Not too difficult, but by no means easy either. You get to take in a cheat sheet which helps a lot. I got an B+ on the first midterm and an A on the second. He tests you on what he lectures in class, and the questions are formatted very much like the quizzes you take online every week (which are honestly no big deal as you get two tries at them anyway and they are only five questions long).The labs were rather time-consuming, but did help reinforce some concepts taught in class, and help serve as buffer points in your grade if you completely bomb a homework assignment. I'm a little wary about my grade in the class considering a large number of people are doing well in the course, so if he curves it, I'm worried that grades may be deflated, but if it is, I will definitely be back on here to report it.Otherwise, Stats 10 with Gould is a very manageable class that will come easy to you if you've taken statistics in high school or a different statistics course previously. Even if you haven't, this class is NOT a GPA killer, and as long as you go to discussion, the concepts should be very clear.

I was in the project class and it was a lot of work lol. I spent 17 hours on the first project and 27 hours on the second project because the grade on one of the checkpoints for the first project scared the bejesus out of me lol. Yes, I kept track of the time I spent. I looked at the sample midterms she posted online and they seemed fairly easy. If the actual midterms were similar in difficulty, I would've spent much less time on preparing for them than I spent on the projects. Although, I will say that I've taken statistics in high school, so I can't really speak for those who haven't taken statistics. Considering that this was the first time the professor introduced the projects, it was expected that the process would be a bit disorganized. However, I did think that her grading was a bit harsh and inconsistent. My group ended up getting 30% lower on a checkpoint than a previous checkpoint which had essentially the same instructions. Sure we managed to get around 13% back, but the difference was still a bit unreasonable. The instructions for the projects were rather ambiguous, which made it difficult to figure out what she wanted. I would be turning in a checkpoint for a project unsure if it would receive an A or a C. If she had posted reliable samples, it would've been easier to figure out what she wanted...But the samples she posted didn't correspond well with her instructions...lol. She does offer a bit of extra credit for the projects, which helps a bit, but it doesn’t completely make up for the number of points that can be lost. If she’s still doing the project thing in the future and posts good, reliable samples, the projects should be alright…but still much more work than the exams in my opinion lol. Good group members also make the experience much better. If you get people in your group who don’t do anything or don’t care, I am very sorry, but your experience may be an academic nightmare. Just sayin’ lol. The final for the class wasn’t too bad. About half of the questions were the exact same as the questions on the sample midterms she posted.  And for one of the harder questions, she pretty much gave away the answer in the question right after it because the two problems were related lol. If you have no background in statistics, I think you can still do fairly well in the class if you self-study and if Professor Le doesn’t give projects. I felt like the projects could’ve easily been grade-killers for groups that knew nothing about statistics. But if it’s just exams, spending like two hours a week reading the textbook and skimming over the lecture slides should be quite helpful. I found the textbook to be fairly interesting and easy to read. Of course, having a good professor makes the process much easier. Professor Le spent like 15-20 minutes every day going over the project, which is somewhat helpful, but then the lectures were rushed. Sure, she went over the important concepts, but she didn’t have time to emphasize them. If I hadn’t taken statistics, I probably would’ve had no idea which concepts were more important and what would’ve been helpful to memorize. But she does provide formula sheets on the exams, so you don’t have to memorize much.IF YOU’VE TAKEN STATISTICS in high school and got a 5 on the AP exam, you should be able to do fairly well in stats 10 regardless of what professor you have. If you got a 4 on the AP exam or maybe even a 3, you’ll probably still be fine. The concepts, at least for what Professor Le went over, only go up to chapter 9 (two sample t-tests). You don’t get to chi-square tests. The stuff before the hypothesis tests/confidence intervals is fairly simple. The probability section might be a bit more confusing, but it’ll be much easier if you draw tree diagrams. If you’re considering risking it and taking this class with Professor Le, you should be fine if she goes back to only giving exams because the class should be entirely review. Anything you’ve forgotten you can easily figure out from the textbook. If she sticks with the projects and you know you’re going to be tight on time during the quarter, I suggest you find a different professor. You can still probably get an A+ in the class if you spend your life on the projects like I did, but you can just as easily end up with like a B if you don’t do every possible thing you can think of for the projects (should the instructions for the projects still be ambiguous). IF YOU’VE NEVER TAKEN STATISTICS before, this class can be quite the doozy. I think you’ll learn more about statistics if you have a different professor. Professor Le is a very nice person, but based on what I observed during her rushed lectures, I think you’ll learn more from lecture with a different professor. I don’t know if it’s the same for other professors, but according to Professor Le’s syllabus, you needed a 94% instead of a 93% to get an A. I thought it was kind of lame because 1% is a lot lol. Regardless, if Professor Le only gives exams in the future, you’ll probably do well self-studying. The questions for the exams (at least for the final) were reasonable because they tested the most important concepts you were supposed to have learned from the class…It just makes your life easier when you have a good professor to help you understand the material better.If you’re going to take this class with Professor Le because you have to, I suggest using your graphing calculator if you have one. If you don’t know the functions, the end of each chapter in the textbook teaches you how to use them. And if you don’t want to read through the textbook, go be buddy buddies with a person who’s taken statistics before and make them teach you everything lol. Hopefully the person will help you out because there’s no point in knowing stuff if you don’t help anyone with it, right? The calculator is especially helpful for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests because you just throw numbers into the calculator and you get all the answers :3. You can also use it for the earlier chapters about binomial probabilities and stuff. Pretty much, the calculator can make your weekly homework assignments easy-peas. Stuff that’s good to memorize for the class or stats 10 in general would be interpreting the r-squared value, the slope, the y-intercept, assumptions for confidence intervals/hypothesis tests (these assumptions are given in the formula sheet though), and conditions for the binomial model. You can find the answers to those from her slides or from the textbook. Overall, if you want statistics 10 to be as easy and chill as it should be, take it with a different professor. If Professor Le’s still giving projects and you’re tight on time, avoid taking this class with her. If she’s going back to exams, you’ll probably just have to study on your own more to figure the stuff out.Meh, hope this kind of helps lol.Good luck on your academic endeavors!",0,0,NEGATIVE,0.9829860329627991

So I ended up taking the class while spending like $15. I did buy the textbook (not included in $15) but that's just because I like to keep a book just in case I need the materials again in the future.Attendance: So far, she teaches 8AM lectures. So that's kind of painful to go to lectures if you are not a morning person.Clickers are served to take attendance, but you can click in only once either at the beginning or end of class, so there are definitely a lot students who come for the last 10 minutes just to click in. There is no make up for missing days, unless you talk with her before hands (I guess?), so be careful. And it's 10% of your grades too, so be considerate.Lectures are OK as she will read off the slides a lot of time, but sometimes she does include examples from computer simulations or elaborates a bit on the materials, so I always go because I find those helpful. I learn well by listening too.Lessons: These are like ""easy"" points. The TAs will go over the lessons with you on Tuesday discussions, and lessons (they are done electronically) next week. So you will pretty much know how to get a perfect before hand. But you might slip off here and there for a few points if you don't pay attention. Lowest lesson score is dropped though.Progress Exams: They are very very fair, sometimes rather straight forward. Down side: they are only 25 points, so you have to be very very careful. There are three: 2 midterms, 1 final. However, I would say that the practice exams that she gave us were somehow easier than the actual ones.Labs: They take a bit of time to finish. You will probably need a full hour during the Thursday lab, and probably a couple more minutes to finish up. But they are pretty straightforward. I will say go to lab because you will need those skills to do the lab exams, and the software we use is only available on computers in that lab, CLICC computers and probably computers in Study Room of Hedrick Hall.Lab Exams: Now, they are a bit tricky. They are both fair, but you really get to know your program and stuff.Overall: The class is good. I learn a lot from Dr. Lew and thinks that she is a good professor.

Because all the material is review, I can usually figure out what she is trying to explain; however, for first-time stats students this must be extremely frustrating. This is not to say the material is difficult to understand, rather that her lectures don't really do anything to make it accessible to the statistics-uninclined.

I am anal retentive about how I do my homework, but I still get slammed 0.3 points on every third problem for no reason I can figure out.

He had a lot of office hours, and he would almost always respond to my emails quickly. Additionally, the class material was not inherently difficult (coming from somebody with zero background in statistics).However, I think any student in the class would agree that the class was not well-structured. I believe this may have partly been the result of this being Odhiambo's first time teaching the class. *It is plausible that Prof. Odhiambo's Stats 10 may be a much better experience in the future.*1. The organization of the class was very messy. I remember that I thought there was no syllabus until I asked a classmate, who told me that it was named ""stats_lecture4"" or something along those lines. In the beginning of the quarter, we also could not access any of the lecture slideshows for a few weeks due to some technical issues.2. As someone who had zero programming experience, learning to program in R was not that bad. However, it was frustrating that Prof. Odhiambo gave fairly unclear/vague directions on some of the first homework assignments, which I thought was not appropriate for beginner programmers. Prof. Odhiambo would also sometimes spend entire lectures programming in R; I appreciate the intention as a way to teach it, but he spent a decent amount of time sorting out issues in real time (such as using the wrong function or using the function incorrectly. An example is him using corr() and never figuring out that it was supposed to be cor(). I understood this, but I figure most people did not and were just very confused).3. Some quizzes suffered from a major amount of typos. On at least one occasion there was a question with no correct answers because of a typo. For the first quiz, we were quizzed on things that were never taught anywhere in the class (nor in the textbook. I would know because I read through all of the chapters listed in the syllabus). Partly compensating for this is the fact that he allowed two attempts on each quiz and always took the better one. Similarly, he would sometimes give flat-out incorrect formulas in class (such as square root-ing the numerator of the correlation coefficient). I am sure that these incorrect formulas confused a decent amount of people.4. In my humble opinion, I believe he did not do an adequate job teaching some of the key concepts. So, Stats 10 as a whole (I believe) is basically just leading up to the concepts of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. I felt that he gave way too little coverage of foundational/key concepts such as the normal distribution / central limit theorem, t distributions, and z/t scores. I believe the topic of the two sample t-tests (both for paired and independent data) were both covered in one 50 minute class period. I felt that he barely, if at all, explained the reasons for doing any of the hypothesis tests. The burden was often placed on the TAs to do much of the teaching. **Massive shoutout to my TA Yunan Yan: he was incredibly nice, helpful, and smart. I would highly advise choosing him as a TA for any statistics course!** 5. Both of the midterms are take-home / do on your own time. However, the second midterm had questions covering content that was not taught anywhere (in lecture or in the textbook), and the study guide for the final also suffered from this same issue. There was a huge amount of uncertainty about what exactly on the study guide would be on the final. I understand that a study guide is better than no study guide generally, but I would say it was somewhat straight up misleading because of things on there that we actually did not need to know. I would estimate about half of the stuff on the study guide were things that we were eventually told would not be on the final.6. There were many issues in grading. I completely do not blame the graders (who were not the TAs), who I am sure were likely just working off Prof. Odhiambo's answer key. One example is that on the last homework, the grading was so incorrect that some people falsely received Ds when their true grades were As (later corrected). Of course, for what it's worth, I am grateful that Prof. Odhiambo went in and corrected grades every time one of these issues arose.",1,0,NEGATIVE,0.847907304763794

However, TAs recorded labs, so this class became entirely online for me.I will not go into detail regarding lecture attendance/ online quizzes since those will probably be discontinued after this quarter.  As for the labs, I am sure it will be the same way, but the TAs will quite literally give you the exact answers during your discussion section. We are required to code in R for lab, but I walked in with no knowledge and did perfectly fine only because the TA feeds us the answers and we did not need to learn/ get tested on coding material.  The homework was also quite easy to get through, but you should always double-check it before turning it in, especially since she does give you ample time to complete it. They grade homework by selecting random sets of problems, so I would suggest that you try on every single problem rather than gamble on which one they would check! If you do not do well on one, it will be dropped! A lab that you did not do well on will be dropped as well.Admittedly, I found Bingling a little hard to follow along to but if you ask her questions during the lecture, she will actively stop and ensure that you are following along well with the material (even just a single person). This class would definitely be easier if you came in with prior knowledge about statistics (I heard AP stats was much harder than this class).

The difficulty of this class primarily depends on if you've been exposed to the topics beforehand, i.e. AP Stats. If you've taken AP Stats and remember everything, this class has nothing new to offer you and is a free A. Otherwise, prepare to study the topics a bit, but it's still quite an easy subject. The workload is very light for the number of units, and tests are all multiple choice with a period in a 24-hour window.--GRADING: Grading is very straightforward in this class, there's no curve and homework is not graded. Participation was required (either through a live Zoom survey, or a short quiz you could take after you watched a recorded lecture). Other than that, there's the weekly quiz, labs, and one midterm and one final. Extra credit was offered for participating in Campuswire, which is really easy. It kind of got out of hand when every question was answered seven times with the same answer, but it's not hurting anyone and it's free points, so why not?--HW: There is literally no graded homework. Selected problems are posted with solutions, but are completely optional, so if you've taken AP Stats and feel confident in the material you can skip it, but it is really good practice. Other than that, there's coding labs with R, which sounds intimidating but you can literally just copy exactly what the TA does in discussions and get 100%. Coding is never on the exams, so just follow along during discussions and it's no problem.--EXAMS: There were around 7 weekly quizzes that were relatively short. They're not timed or anything, and you can start them anytime during the week, though you only have one attempt. Overall, not a big deal as long as you keep up with the material. Midterms and finals were of the same format, one long CCLE quiz you had 90 minutes to take in a 24 hour interval. Very fair questions, and anytime there were issues, the question got fixed and points reimbursed. Exams and quizzes together make up 60% of the grade, so do make sure you're prepared for them though!--SUMMARY: Wang is a decent lecturer, if a bit boring at times, but she's very nice/approachable. There's many office hours for help, and the Campuswire is super active. I'd recommend this class/professor for a requirement or a GE.

His lectures are very clear with the content and relatable applications, often amusing with his interesting jokes/comments, and his attempt to connect with the students and himself, through Campuswire and proper communication, is distinct and commendable (in fact, I think he connected with the students on a personal level almost unparalleled than any faculty member I encountered at UCLA). I am satisfied that I took this course over the summer, and it will be an experience that I will not forget for the rest of my life.

I should mention that R was my first programming language, and prior to this course I had only worked with R in a very superficial manner in another course. I think the class was split between students who had more programming experience and those that didn’t, so (as someone who compares themselves to others) it felt like I was behind the curve at times. I brought this up once or twice with Dr. Mike during office hours with other students and he always reminded us that we were doing fine and to specifically stop comparing ourselves to others. He also would remind us that it was normal to master some of the concepts in the course, as attempting to learn a programming language in 6 weeks is an especially difficult task. Dr. Mike always made himself available for questions on the course, however what I appreciated the most was that he would also be willing to talk about things outside of the course material: grad school, upper div stats courses, life, really anything.  HW’s assignments are graded upon completion, but there has to be an effort to solve the problems. The questions can be pretty difficult if you’re new programming BUT if you’re actually trying to learn the material they genuinely did help drive the concepts home (at least for me personally). The midterm and final were definitely hard, however there was a strong curve in the class based upon the grade distributions and other factors. I got a 75% on the midterm however that translated to an A/A- after the curve. All in all the course was difficult but rewarding.

Admittedly, this class was relatively easy in terms of class content. As someone who didn't take AP Stats, it was easy to follow along, although there were some concepts that I had some trouble with. But all in all, if you pay attention to the lectures and read through the textbook you should be fine. I had this class entirely in person. So his lectures are about an hour and fifteen and he uses powerpoints, which I believe he posts on CCLE. He also recorded his lectures so it wasn't a big issue if you missed some classes; although participation doesn't matter, he did pass around a paper a few times throughout the quarter as a sign-in sheet, but that was for the school, not the class. As a lecturer, he's pretty good; he explains the concepts pretty well and gives a lot of examples in his slides; I found myself understanding the contents of the course pretty well. The real kicker was the exams. He does provide sample exams for the midterm and final, but I wouldn't put too much trust into those as representative of the actual exams. From what I know, they're recycled questions from throughout all the stats classes. In my opinion, Wu's exams were much much harder than the sample he gives; the samples probably work as a reminder, but the actual exams were more specific and were often worded in a tricky way. It was entirely multiple-choice, about 25-26 questions, each worth about 4 points. But you can see that missing a few questions isn't desirable. I believe for my class, the midterm mean was 71, which he did not curve by the way, and the final mean was about 66. I would say, the quiz questions are the closest to the types of questions you'll get on the exams. You get about 6 or so quizzes on CCLE, one attempt but it's not timed. As for homework and labs, they were manageable; he wanted everything to be typed. We got 6 homework assignments, the 7th one being extra credit, an extra 2% to our grade. The homework assignments are relatively easy, all from the textbook, and all based on the content we learned, and if you didn't remember, you could look back in the textbook. The textbook is mandatory, but I got it through the Inclusive Access thing. For the odd questions, you can check your answers in the back of the book, for the evens, the odd question before was usually a similar style of question. FYI, some questions had multiple parts. And often, the longest questions for me were the calculating ones; you can imagine how long calculating standard deviation usually takes, especially when you're typing out the equation and showing all your work. The labs are pretty difficult to go through on your own if you don't already have knowledge in R coding; you do have to download R but they show you how to do it. We had 5 labs. I would say it depends on your TA. Personally, my TA (Vincent Liu) was a bit shy and awkward, very quiet, and didn't really explain well, but he basically gave us a walkthrough of the labs; an easy way to ace the labs. He did it step by step (I can't speak for the other TA's), so going to the discussions is what I recommend for labs. I got perfect scores on my labs because of it.",0,0,POSITIVE,0.9046474099159241

There was a loudass chick talking while she was lecturing, which was really annoying. But how did Sanchez deal with it? She got pissed and yelled ""SHUT UP!!!""

And honestly, her 100A and 100B are completely separate. The terms she uses for population and samples are basically the same, so you never actually know what she's asking for(EG: estimated sample variance vs. sigma hat squared vs. S^2). For those who take this class without taking Stats 10 or forgot most of their AP stats, she briskly goes through the material, and those without this background often don't really understand why we run certain tests and under what assumptions(so I definitely recommend taking Stats 10, which I took concurrently for GE credit lol).For the final, literally 5 of the 30 MC questions she gave us either didn't have the right answer as an option, so she either said ""choose  _"" or ""choose what is CLOSEST to your answer""... like... what? EG the options are 12, 17, 19, 23 and you get 6...Before the midterm, the point dist was: 3 quizzes of 5% each, 35% midterm, 35% final, 5% participation(which are either attendance or last minute quizzes she crams in), and 10% homework, 2 of which are dropped. But because midterm scores were so horrendous(median was like 70% or 21/20, skewed left with some 30s%), she made the final easier imo and made it worth more. There is a curve at the end depending on percentile, but whoever hasn't dropped after the midterm honestly is either an international student who already learned it, or a mathematician/CS legend who knows it, so you end up just struggling.

They take up so much time and are ridiculously hard as well; personally don't feel like Christou was very helpful during office hours since he would often tell me to look at the answer key, but maybe I was just asking the wrong questions. Initially homework was stressful because they graded on accuracy, but they switched to grading on completion mid-quarter after realizing that it was impossible for people not to fail their assignments. Hopefully they keep it that way for future quarters.Final 35%• Similar to midterm, just felt like 3 hours of suffering to me. One person tried to leave early and give up on the final, but Christou looked through his paper and asked him kindly to sit down and try to complete it. You could tell it was because he cared for the student and wanted to him to succeed. By the end of it, I was so glad the class was over.TL;DR: Overall, this class was really emotionally difficult for me and was extremely challenging. Christou really is a kind soul and is well-loved by his past students, and I can see why – he cares for his students and always told us to study well because it would be helpful for our future. But if you choose to take this class with him, be prepared for an intense workload and horrible raw scores, though you can always trust the curve.",1,0,POSITIVE,0.9983793497085571

We did not get to ANOVA, so rather than rushing he chose to omit it from the final.In terms of assignments, it was mostly manageable, but sometimes there was not a lot of time to complete them.
